Pierre Thomas is headed to injured reserve
Posted on January 5 , 2011 , 3 : 37 PM EDT
Pierre Thomas and Chris Ivory are out .
DeShawn Wynn and Joique Bell are in .
Suddenly , the No . 5 Saints don ’ t look as quite as big a threat to make a repeat trip to the Super Bowl .
One day after Chris Ivory was surprisingly lost for the season , the Saints placed Thomas on injured reserve .
The team ’ s best running back also sat out in Week 17 .
Coach Sean Payton said Thomas suffered a setback in practice last week .
We ’ ve been toying with the idea of picking the Saints to make it back to the Super Bowl .
They ’ ve turned the ball over too much , but their defense is a lot better than people think .
This news makes it harder .
It ’ s going to be a lot harder for the New Orleans offense to stay balanced with Reggie Bush and Julius Jones carrying the load .
Wynn and Bell were added to the roster in the last two days , but figure to be reserves .
