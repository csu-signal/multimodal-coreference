Maurice Cheeks became the fifth NBA head coach to be fired this season , after the Philadelphia 76ers notified the former point guard of his dismissal Saturday morning .
Expected to contend for a division title after the addition of Elton Brand , the Sixers ( 9-14 ) are instead last in the Atlantic after losing eight of their last 10 games .
An 88-72 road loss to the Cavaliers in Cleveland Friday was apparently the last straw , though the team has not enjoyed a winning season under Cheeks in his previous three years at the helm .
They had been on the verge of a resurgence as December started , improving their record to 7-6 before hitting a slump to fall to dead last in the division .
Assistant general manager Tony DiLeo was appointed interim coach as the Sixers get ready for a game against Washington Saturday night .
Cheeks is 284-286 lifetime , including four years in Portland .
