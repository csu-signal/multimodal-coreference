on July 02 2013 7 : 41 AM
A magnitude - 6 . 1 earthquake struck Indonesia's Aceh province on Tuesday at 07 : 37 a . m . UTC ( 3 : 37 a . m . EDT ) , killing at least one and leaving two others missing , the Associated Press reported .
The epicenter of the quake , which originated six miles beneath the surface , was located 34 miles west of the town of Bireun , near the western coast of Sumatra island , according to the U . S . Geological Survey .
No tsunami warnings were issued following the quake , which injured dozens and damaged several houses in Takengon , the capital of Central Aceh district , AP reported .
People ran out of their homes when the quake hit , AP reported , citing residents of Bukit Sama village in Central Aceh district , where the quake has led to a power outage .
"I see many houses were damaged and their roofs fell onto some people , " a Bukit Sama village resident told AP .
"Many people were injured but it is difficult to evacuate them due to traffic jams . "
Indonesia is prone to seismic activity , due to its location on the Pacific Basin's "Ring of Fire , " a 25 , 000 - mile - long stretch where earthquakes are common , although only a small percentage are strong enough to be felt .
The 2004 tsunami that killed about 230 , 000 people across Asia was triggered by a massive 9 . 1 - magnitude quake off Aceh .
