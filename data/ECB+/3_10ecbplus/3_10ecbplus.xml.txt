Texas prisoner captured after week on the run
7 : 15 a . m . Dec . 7 , 2009
A convicted sex offender who was the subject of a weeklong manhunt after pulling off a daring escape during a prison transfer was captured Monday after authorities received several phone tips , including one from a salesman who recognized the inmate outside his business .
A hungry , wet and barefoot Arcade Joseph Comeaux Jr . was caught in northeast Houston , about 25 miles northwest of where he escaped , said Alfredo Perez , a spokesman for the U . S . Marshals Service .
Comeaux , 49 , was in a wheelchair Nov . 30 when he pulled a gun on two guards and fired it during a transfer from a prison unit in Huntsville to one in Beaumont .
The guards , who were unharmed , were forced to drive to the Baytown area , where Comeaux took their weapons , handcuffed them together and ran away .
Comeaux was serving a sentence of life in prison for a 1998 aggravated sexual assault conviction in Brazos County , northwest of Houston .
He was given two extra life sentences after being convicted of stabbing his wife and another person in 1999 while she visited him in prison .
