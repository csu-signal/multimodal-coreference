Hollywood's Mermaid , Esther Williams dies at 91
June 06 , 2013
Esther Williams , whose experiences as a young swimming champion led to a career of Hollywood "aqua - musicals" designed just for her , died on Thursday in Beverly Hills , California , at the age of 91 , her spokesman said .
Williams , one of the biggest box - office stars of the 1940s and 1950s , died peacefully in her sleep and had been in declining health due to old age , spokesman Harlan Boll said .
It was the pool - and wartime pinup pictures of her in bathing suits - that made her popular .
