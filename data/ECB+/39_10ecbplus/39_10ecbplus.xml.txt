"I can't wait to start this new adventure ! "
Ben Stephenson , controller of BBC Drama commissioning , said : "We started thinking Peter Capaldi might be the right person to take on this iconic part a few months ago .
"But it was only when he did a secret audition at Steven's house under the cover of darkness that we knew we had our man .
He's an extraordinarily talented actor who can seemingly turn his hand to anything .
"We can't wait to premiere his unique take on the Doctor on Christmas Day and we are sure he's going to become one of the all - time classic Doctors . "
