Footage Of Brooklyn Mother's Fatal Shooting Released During Trial
Apr 12 , 2013
Video of Brooklyn Mother of 13 Zurana Horton shot and killed in a gang shooting was revealed Thursday , according to the N . Y . Daily News .
The footage shows 34 - year - old Horton ( pictured ) picking up her daughter from school on October 21 , 2011 , in Brooklyn's Brownsville section .
Around 2 : 18 p . m . , Horton and two other Moms are seen waiting at an intersection as a yellow bus pulls up to the curb .
The shooting then breaks out , with Horton pushing a child out of the way to take a bullet .
She then grips her chest and collapses to the ground .
Prosecutors showed the tragic footage at the trial of the two youths charged with murdering Horton .
Twenty - year - old Andrew Lopez has been accused of carelessly firing at rival gang members from a rooftop .
Half - brother Jonathan Carrasquillo is suspected of having directed Lopez to kill their enemies .
Both are charged with murder , with Lopez standing accused of letting off 13 shots in Horton's death .
One of the two Mothers with Horton that day testified at the trial .
"I saw her fall back . . .
I saw blood coming from her , " said Unique Armstead , who is seen in the video covering her son with her body as the shooting began .
Armstead sustained a gunshot wound to her left arm .
Armstead said she heard someone say , "He has a gun , " prompting her to take her son inside a nearby corner bodega for safety .
When the coast seemed clear , they reportedly went back out , which is when the shots began .
"I thought it was a brick but it was a bullet , " Armstead said .
"I told my son , I think I'm shot . "
The trial is scheduled to resume Monday , with testimony from a man who claims Lopez's brother threatened to kill him ; he is reportedly scared to take the stand .
"The man is petrified , " Judge Vincent DelGiudice said .
"The man is an emotional wreck . "
