Lindsay Lohan rehires longtime lawyer Shawn Holley , heads to rehab
Published May 03 , 2013
It seems Lindsay Lohan has had enough of New York attorney Mark Jay Heller .
The actress re - hired longtime attorney Shawn Holley to handle her case .
Heller told a judge during a hearing Thursday morning that Lohan had checked in to the Morningside Recovery rehab facility , but the starlet left it after a few minutes .
The actress , however , has since checked in to a different rehab but will not face a probation violation for leaving another treatment facility after a few minutes , a prosecutor said Friday .
Lohan made it to the new facility late Thursday , TMZ reported .
White said he has received confirmation that Lohan has checked in to a rehab facility and he is satisfied with her location .
He declined to say where Lohan is receiving treatment , but reports soon surfaced that she was at the Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage , Calif .
"Lindsay never checked into Morningside but is back at Betty Ford .
The challenge now is to keep her there for the 90 days , " the source told us .
Lohan has spent time at Betty Ford before .
She served another mandatory rehab sentence at the treatment center , although her stay there was not without drama .
