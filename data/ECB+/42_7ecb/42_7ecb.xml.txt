Well that was a neat little progression : Early suspicions , followed by a purported internal leak , capped with an official announcement .
T-Mobile will be adding the BlackBerry Curve 8900 to their lineup come February .
The press release does n't get any more specific than that , but seems to lend authority to the previous leak , which indicated that the 18th would be the day .
