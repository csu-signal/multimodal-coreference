Chargers Jamal Williams arrested for DUI
In the steeped NFL tradition of drinking and driving , Chargers NT Jamal Williams is doing his part to uphold the tradition .
Of course , football is the ultimate team game and fellow Charger Vincent Jackson was arrested last month for DUI as well .
Although results are pending for the blood - alcohol test that Williams took , he has been booked and later released on bail .
While I make fun of a topic that definitely isn't funny , I still don't understand how these players with their multi - million dollar salaries don't hire drivers or car services .
