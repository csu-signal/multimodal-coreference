Internet service in Egypt , the UAE , India and other counties in the region was interrupted today when submarine cables in the Mediterranean Sea failed .
Cause of the failure is not known at this time , says operator Reliance GlobalCom .
A total of three cables linking Italy and Egypt went down .
A ship has been sent out to fix the problems .
Currently , services are being rerouted to backup cables and satellites .
As rerouting measures fully kick in , services are expected to improve by early Saturday morning .
This is n't the first time that cable service to the region has failed .
Earlier this year , five separate undersea cables were cut between late January and early February , interrupting service to a number of countries .
There 's likely to be some serious failure analysis involved if we see some more pipes go off-line in the next week .
