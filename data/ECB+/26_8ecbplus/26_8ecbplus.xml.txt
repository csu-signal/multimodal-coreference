Vincent 'The Chin' Gigante Dies in Prison
Edited on Mon Dec - 19 - 05 03 : 49 PM
Mob boss Vincent "The Chin" Gigante , the powerful Mafioso who avoided jail for decades by wandering the streets in a ratty bathrobe and slippers , feigning mental illness , died Monday in prison .
He was 77 .
The head of the Genovese crime family , who had suffered from heart disease , died at the federal prison in Springfield , Mo . , said prison spokesman Al Quintero .
It was the same place where rival mob boss John Gotti died of cancer in 2002 at age 61 .
Gigante's death also was confirmed by Christine Monaco , a spokeswoman for the FBI , the organization that worked for years to put him behind bars .
Dubbed the "Oddfather" for his bizarre behavior , Gigante had scored a lengthy string of victories over prosecutors , but it ended with a July 1997 racketeering conviction .
He was sentenced to 12 years in prison .
After a quarter - century of public craziness , he finally admitted his insanity ruse at an April 2003 federal hearing in which he calmly pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice .
That brought him another three - year sentence .
. . .
For the man described by The New York Times Magazine as "the last great Mafioso of the century , " his admission was the final act in a 50 - year career linking the era of old - time gangsters and the modern - day Mafia of Gotti .
