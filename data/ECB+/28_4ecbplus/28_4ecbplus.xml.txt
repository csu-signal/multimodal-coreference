His body was discovered Tuesday by a maid who entered his hotel room in Biloxi , Coroner Gary Hargrove said .
The coroner said he believes Mr . LaRue died Saturday ( July 24 , 2004 ) .

Mr . LaRue served as special assistant to John Mitchell , the former attorney general who later headed President Richard Nixon's re - election committee .
Mr . LaRue was at a 1972 meeting with Mitchell and Nixon aide Jeb Stuart Magruder in Key Biscayne , where the plan to break into the Watergate complex allegedly was hatched .
