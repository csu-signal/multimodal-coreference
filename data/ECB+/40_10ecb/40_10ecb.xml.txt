While Apple 's final keynote address at the annual MacWorld convention in San Francisco did n't contain the iPhone-related announcements many had hoped for , we were given all of the details on Apple 's latest revamp to their largest and most powerful MacBook Pro .
Apple 's senior vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing , Philip Schiller , delivered the address and detailed the major revisions to the 17 '' MacBook Pro .
First off , the 17 '' MacBook Pro will be , as Apple puts it , `` the world 's thinnest and lightest 17-inch notebook , '' coming in at less than an inch thick ( 0.98 '' to be precise ) and with an overall weight of 6.6 pounds .
Like it 's smaller siblings that were given a facelift back in October , the new 17 '' MacBook Pro will utilize an aluminum unibody design that brings the behemoth notebook into the new , `` greener '' future .
The new 17 '' MacBook Pro achieves EPEAT Gold status that identifies the device as an environmentally responsible solution .
As part of its EPEAT Gold status , the new 17 '' model is reportedly free of many of the harmful toxins found in comparable notebooks that have adverse effects on the environment during disposal .
As part of the new MacBook family , the 17 '' MacBook Pro incorporates an arsenic and mercury-free glass LED-backlit display .
But beyond the environmental improvements , the biggest news regarding the latest MacBook Pro is its revolutionary battery system .
Through the use of advanced chemistry , intelligent monitoring , adaptive charging technology , and a multi-cell design that Apple claims achieves three times the industry standard in battery life .
The new battery system will deliver eight hours on a single charge and can be recharged up to 1,000 times in a single lifespan .
On the performance side , the 17 '' MacBook Pro has similar performance specs to previous MacBook Pro models .
The processor , memory , and drive specs on the new model are as follows:
The new model incorporates all of the usual MacBook Pro luxuries , such as built-in iSight , three USB ports , mini-display port output , a FireWire 800 port , and ExpressCard/34 support .
Similar to the other MacBook models , the trackpad has been updated to incorporate Apple 's new multi-touch gestures and buttonless design .
The new 17 '' MacBook Pro will come in one default configuration with a MSRP of $ 2,799 , however , users will be able to upgrade their notebook with Apple 's built-to-order program .
Optional upgrades include a 8GBs of DDR3 memory , a 320GB hard drive , a 128GB or 256GB solid state drive , and various display output alternatives .
If the glass LED-backlit display causes too much glare for you , Apple also offers an anti-glare display on the 17 '' MacBook Pro for $ 50 extra .
The new 17 '' MacBook Pro will be shipping at the end of this month .
