LIKELY FOE : Saints suffer major injury , Thomas to IR
4 : 31 pm January 5 , 2011
The Saints have placed running back Pierre Thomas on injured reserve .
Here ’ s the story from my buddy Mike Tripplett over at the New Orleans Times - Picayune .
In the Saints 17 - 14 victory over the Falcons on Dec . 27 , Thomas rushed for 63 yards and scored on a 2 - yard touchdown in the second quarter .
He joins the team ’ s top rusher , Chris Ivory , on the injured reserve .
It looks like Reggie Bush will have to carry the rushing load .
They also recently signed rookie Joique Bell ( Wayne State ) from the Philadelphia Eagles ’ practice squad .
They also signed veteran DeShawn Wynn ( Florida ) on Tuesday to serve as a backup behind Bush and Julius Jones .
If the Saints beat Seattle and Philadelphia beats Green Bay , the Falcons will face the Saints at 8 p . m . Saturday , Jan . 15 at the Georgia Dome .
