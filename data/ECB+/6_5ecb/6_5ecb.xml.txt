There 's a new dawn for Twilight .
Days after Catherine Hardwicke was ousted , despite having directed the vampire romance satisfactorily enough to pull in $ 140 million worth of business from fanggirls and average moviegoers alike , The Golden Compass director Chris Weitz is close to signing on for the blockbuster 's sequel .
Following up on some recent Deadline Hollywood scoop , EW.com reports that Weitz has been tapped by Summit Entertainment to helm New Moon , based on the second book in Stephenie Meyer 's phenomenon-inducing franchise .
`` He 's the quality-of-life-choice , '' a source said , perhaps referring to buzz that Hardwicke , while ultratalented , is rough to work with , while Weitz , who also codirected American Pie and scored an Oscar nod for copenning About a Boy , is known to be a pretty genial chap .
Summit says that no deal has been signed yet , but the official announcement could be coming as soon as this weekend .
The studio wants New Moon in theaters and Edward-loving butts in the seats in 2010 , but has said it will not rush production before the script ( the initial draft of which Hardwicke supposedly had problems with ) is the best it can be .
`` This is not a rush job , '' Summit CEO Rob Friedman told the Los Angeles Times ' Big Picture blog .
`` The movie only gets released when it 's finished. I 'd like it to be next year , but we 're not going to put out a bad movie to hit a release date . ''
