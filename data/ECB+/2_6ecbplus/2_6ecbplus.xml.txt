Ellen DeGeneres to Host Next Year ’ s Oscars
Published : August 2 , 2013
Reaching back to television for a comedy star , the producers of the Academy Awards telecast announced Friday that Ellen DeGeneres would return next year to host the annual Oscar ceremony .
The producers , Craig Zadan and Neil Meron , caused some backlash last year after giving the job to Seth MacFarlane , the creator of the “ Family Guy ” animated show on the Fox network .
Ms . DeGeneres has even less to do with the theatrical movie business than Mr . MacFarlane does ( his movie “ Ted ” preceded his appearance ) but she is well liked in Hollywood and her performance as the host of the show in 2007 was widely praised .
In typical fashion , she released a jokey response to the honor : “ I am so excited to be hosting the Oscars for the second time .
You know what they say — the third time ’ s the charm . ”
