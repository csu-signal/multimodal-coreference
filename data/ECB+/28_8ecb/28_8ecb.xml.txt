Mark `` Deep Throat '' Felt Dead at 95
W. Mark Felt , Sr. , the number 2 man at the FBI during the Watergate scandal , died yesterday from Alzheimer 's disease at a hospice near his home in Santa Rosa , California , the Washington Post reports .
Felt was an instrumental player in the stunning downfall of President Nixon , but his identity as `` Deep Throat '' -reporter Bob Woodard 's anonymous source for the Post 's bombshell series of scoops on the Watergate affair in 1972-was unknown until three years ago , when Felt 's family unmasked him in the pages of Vanity Fair .
According to the Times , even Woodward was shocked at this ;
he had gaurded the secret so zealously that even his partner Carl Bernstein did not meet Felt until earlier this year .
Felt never revealed why he leaked details on the Watergate break-in and cover up to Woodward , but the Times obituary points out that in May 1972 Feld had been passed over by Nixon as Edgar Hoover 's successor to run the bureau .
