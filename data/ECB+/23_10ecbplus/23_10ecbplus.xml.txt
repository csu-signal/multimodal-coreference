A British climber has fallen to his death in New Zealand .
Robert Buckley , 32 , fell about 2 , 000 feet while climbing to a small hut on Mount Sefton in the Aoraki - Mount Cook national park on Saturday , police said .
Buckley , who had been living and working in Christchurch , was one of four men who were trying to climb to the Sefton Bivvy from Mount Cook Village , according to New Zealand media reports .
They were within 80m of their destination when Buckley slipped .
His companions raised the alarm , but then got stuck .
A rescue helicopter found Buckley and the others but they could not be rescued until the next morning .
Buckley's body was recovered later in the day .
Police said in a statement it appeared the group was insufficiently equipped and experienced for the climb .
The three other climbers were released after an examination by medical staff .
The day before Buckley's death another climber , 36 - year - old Duncan Rait , died after slipping and falling about 200 feet from a ridge in the same national park .
The New Zealand - born man , who lived in Australia , had been been dropped off by helicopter and was walking to a hut when he fell in the Tasman Glacier area .
Police spokesman Dave Gaskin said the deaths were a reminder that climbers needed to use extreme caution .
'I cant speak for the first death , but in this case it looks like to be a lack of experience , " Gaskin told the Timaru Herald .
A Foreign Office spokeswoman said : "We are aware of the death of a British man in New Zealand .
We are providing consular assistance at this time .
