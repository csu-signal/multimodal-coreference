Waitrose fire in Wellington town centre tackled
Crews from Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue have tackled a blaze at a supermarket in a Somerset town .
The fire service was called at 06 : 00 BST to the Waitrose store in High Street , Wellington , on Sunday .
Half the roof at the entrance of the building has collapsed but the main building is in intact with only smoke damage , fire crews said .
Matt Goodman , from the fire service , said : "It would appear the fire started on the outside of the building . "
"It then quickly spread to the roof so there is a significant amount of damage to the roof , but thankfully due to the early actions of the Wellington crew we could get a large weight of response to the scene .
"We've been able to prevent it spreading to other areas of the building , so the main store on the inside has got a reasonably small amount of smoke damage . "
Engineers were called to switch off the electricity supply to the building .
A spokesman for Waitrose said : "Luckily no - one has been hurt and we are very grateful to the fire service and police for their prompt and professional help . "
An investigation into the cause of the fire has begun .
