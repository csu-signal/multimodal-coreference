Mark Felt , ' Deep Throat ' of Watergate , dead at 95
W. Mark Felt , who leaked information to reporters under the moniker , `` Deep Throat , '' about the Watergate break-in , died Thursday at the age of 95 , sources told CNN .
Mark Felt , known as `` Deep Throat , '' divulged information to reporters about the Watergate break-in .
Rob Jones , Felt 's grandson , said his grandfather died at his home in Santa Rosa , California .
According to published reports , Felt died of congestive heart failure .
Felt admitted in a 2005 Vanity Fair article he was the Washington Post 's source for many of its 400 stories on the Watergate affair during the early nineteen seventies .
The Watergate break-in eventually led to the 1974 resignation of President Richard Nixon .
`` I 'm proud of everything that Deep Throat did , '' Felt , 92 , told CNN 's `` Larry King Live '' in 2006 , his first public interview on the subject .
Felt 's entanglement with history occurred in 1972 after the bungled break-in at the Democratic National Party offices in the Watergate hotel .
Felt , an associate director at the FBI , said he was unhappy with the way the administration meddled with the investigation into the break-in , which led him to divulge information to the newspaper .

Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward , then-rookie reporters with the Washington Post , did stories about the break-in and subsequent cover-up .
Both men credited Felt for helping them , but Bernstein said Felt was a tough interview .
`` He did n't leak .
He had to really be squeezed , '' Bernstein said in a 2006 interview .
`` He confirmed mostly what we had gotten elsewhere .
He did n't want to volunteer a lot of information , yet his role was essential in giving us a solidity and a knowledge that what we were reporting was right . ''
