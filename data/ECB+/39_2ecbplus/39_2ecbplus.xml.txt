Showrunner , 51 , adds that Malcolm Tucker will not cast a shadow over new Time Lord : "You know when the Doctor is in the room"
Doctor Who boss Steven Moffat has revealed that Peter Capaldi was the only name considered to take over from Matt Smith .
Speaking after last night's announcement of The Thick of It star as the Twelfth Doctor , Moffat also said that the 55 - year - old's lifelong love of Doctor Who had been an aspect when it came to casting him .
Asked whether the list of Time Lord contenders was a short one , Moffat said : "Yes .
The list went 'Peter Capaldi' .
It was a very short list . "
He added : " [ Capaldi came into consideration ] a fair amount of time ago .
I happened to know he's a big fan .
"There's something very seductive about an utterly brilliant , arresting looking leading man actor - one of the most talented actors in Britain - who you happen to know is a big fan of the show .
"You start to think 'maybe we should so something about that' . "
The 51 - year - old showrunner also insisted that Capaldi's most heralded and readily identifiable previous role - as sweary spin doctor Malcolm Tucker - would not overshadow his new position in charge of the TARDIS .
"You know when the Doctor is in the room , " said Moffat .
"I've seen the Doctor not be in the room when you say those lines out loud .
"And just to check we weren't mad we showed it to [ BBC head of drama ] Ben [ Stephenson ] .
And we all just thought 'Yes , obviously that's it .
The Doctor's in the room' . "
Producer Moffat , who is also a co - creator of Sherlock , is sure that fans will agree that Capaldi is the perfect choice .
"When you watched him walk out in the room tonight , didn't you just think 'well , there he is' ? " he said .
"Suddenly he's the Doctor .
Malcolm Tucker is knocked out of the way .
He's just suddenly this magnificent new man . "
Last night's unveiling of Capaldi was watched by 6 . 1m people ( a 29 . 8% share of the TV - watching audience ) , peaking at 6 . 9m .
