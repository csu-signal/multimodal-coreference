Gary Ross in negotiations to direct 'The Hunger Games' sequel 'Catching Fire'
April 4 , 2012
Despite currently being the director behind the #1 movie in the world , the future of Gary Ross's involvement with The Hunger Games franchise remains uncertain .
The Hollywood Reporter says Ross is in negotiations with Lionsgate to return as director for the sequel , Catching Fire - - and the deal likely hinges on money .
THR says Ross , a seasoned director , accepted a relatively low $3 million salary for directing ( and co - writing ) The Hunger Games , but is asking for a significant raise for Catching Fire .
Despite THR's article , which paints negotiations as tense , Ross has spoken very confidently about his involvement in Catching Fire - - even mentioning casting ideas and filming plans - - and it seems likely he will officially be signed on as director .
Meanwhile , the film's main stars , including Jennifer Lawrence , Josh Hutcherson , and Liam Hemsworth , are all signed on for the rest of the movies in the series .
Several additional new characters will need to be cast before Catching Fire can begin filming later this year , however .
