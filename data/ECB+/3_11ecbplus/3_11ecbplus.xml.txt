FALLOUT CONTINUES AFTER BRAZEN ESCAPE
The Texas Department of Criminal Justice has made sweeping leadership changes at a Huntsville prison where an inmate managed to get a gun that he later used to escape , the agency announced Tuesday .
The Nov . 30 escape by Arcade Joseph Comeaux Jr . , a convicted rapist recaptured last month after eight days on the run in Baytown and Houston , has led to unprecedented fallout at the prison unit where he was housed , with the largest number of TDCJ employees ever facing termination or disciplinary action because of a single incident , said TDCJ Inspector General John Moriarty .
Comeaux , 49 , escaped from a prison van in Baytown after he pulled a gun on two TDCJ officers driving him to another prison in Beaumont .
He was at large until Dec . 7 , when he was found shoeless , wet and hungry at a north Houston business , where he asked to use the phone .
So far , 11 Estelle unit employees have been recommended for termination or faced consequences related to Comeaux's escape .
Four of those elected to retire instead of facing disciplinary action , including the two officers who drove Comeaux in the van on the day he escaped .
Whitmire questioned why several prisons , including the Estelle unit , stopped searching visitors two months before Comeaux's escape and moved to random pat - downs .
Since Comeaux's jailbreak , all visitors and employees at the Estelle prison unit are again subject to mandatory pat - downs , Lyons said .
