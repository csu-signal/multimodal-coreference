Saturday , 28 September 2013 01 : 43	
A jury in eastern Oklahoma has convicted a Spiro man of two counts of first - degree murder in the 2012 shooting death of his pregnant girlfriend .
The jury deliberated almost seven hours Thursday before convicting 27 - year - old Christopher Kenyon Simpson in the death of 20 - year - old Ka'loni Flynn , of Fort Smith , Ark .
The jury recommended the maximum sentence of life in prison without parole , the Southwest Times Record reported ( http : / / bit . ly / 16vDN3E ) .
He is to be sentenced Nov . 8 .
Prosecutors allege that Simpson shot Flynn twice in the head because he did not want another child to support .
A DNA expert testified that Simpson fathered the fetus .
"I'm glad it's over .
I'm glad we got the verdict we got , " said Flynn's father , Herbert Flynn .
"She deserved it . "
During closing arguments , Crawford County Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Jacob Howell showed a photograph of Flynn's body in the driver's seat of car , with bullet wounds to her temple and forehead .
Some audience members gasped loudly .
"We know that's how we got here , " Howell said , indicating the photo .
Prosecutors acknowledged that the case against Simpson was complicated and mostly circumstantial .
