Kraft Shooting : Yvonne Hiller Charged With Two Counts Of Murder
A Kraft Foods plant worker who had been suspended for feuding with colleagues , then escorted from the building , returned minutes later with a handgun , found her foes in a break room and executed two of them with a single bullet each and critically wounded a third , police said Friday .
Yvonne Hiller , 43 , had gotten into an argument Thursday evening with her co - workers at the northeast Philadelphia plant , police said .
After she was disciplined , she went to her vehicle , made several phone calls , and then grabbed a . 357 Magnum and used it to force her way past security guards at the front gate .
About 100 people were at work at the plant , which makes Nabisco cookies and crackers .
Hiller walked to the third - floor mixing area and found four people in the break room .
She had no quarrels with one woman and told her to leave .
She then opened fire on the others , Philadelphia Homicide Capt . James Clark said .
"She believed they were spraying chemicals at her , saying things behind her back , " Clark said .
After leaving the break room , Hiller went down a hallway and fired shots at the supervisor who had suspended her and at a mechanic who was using a walkie - talkie to alert police and co - workers to her whereabouts , police said .
She missed both .
Hiller finally went to a second - floor office and called police to tell them what she had done , authorities said .
Seven other workers were hiding in a closet nearby .
Cpl . Janice Leader , a 911 dispatcher , told reporters Friday that Hiller called 911 , saying "I'm the one you're looking for" and reporting that she had been harassed at work .
Keeping her on the line , Leader said she told Hiller to put the gun down and place her hands on her head so officers wouldn't take any aggressive action against her .
