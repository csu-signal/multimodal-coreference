The New Orleans Saints placed Reggie Bush on injured reserve today , officially ending his third NFL season .
It 's the second straight year that Bush failed to make it to the last week of the season .
It 's also the second straight year that Bush took steps backward after a strong rookie season .
Bush , who missed several games after arthroscopic knee surgery earlier this season , wraps up the year with 404 yards rushing and 440 yards receiving .
He scored six touchdowns on offense and added three more on punt returns .
There 's nothing wrong with nine touchdowns in 10 games , but Bush 's inability to stay on the field has made him something less than the Saints expected with the second overall pick in the 2006 Draft .
Leon Washington of the Jets , a fourth-rounder that year , has turned in similar production as Bush this season ( in more games ) but costs his team much less money .
Making matters worse is the fact that the relationship between Bush and coach Sean Payton seems to be deteriorating .
Bush expressed unhappiness about being yanked from last week 's loss to the Bears , two weeks after Payton made a similar move against the Bucs .
Whatever his shortcomings , Bush could still play an important role in the supercharged Saints offense .
Unless he loses Payton 's faith once and for all , of course .
