October 20 , 2011
Subsea cable operator , Seacom , announced on Twitter today ( 20 October 2011 ) that they have restored services to all customers using alternate routes , following an outage that was initially expected to take 12 days to repair .
In a statement published on its official website , Seacom said that a repair vessel is now in transit .
"The vessel has received the master permit for this repair ; operational permits are being finalized and should be received prior to arrival on the repair ground , " Seacom said .
The repair is now expected to be completed in late October , but Seacom warned that "the usual exogenous factors associated with sub - sea repairs , including weather and currents , may further impact the repair . "
Seacom started to experience problems on Saturday , 8 October 2011 , which it said was caused by a problem on a cable between Abu Talat in Egypt and Marseilles in France .
Last week Friday ( 14 October 2011 ) , Seacom announced that it had restored services to its business customers , which included Internet service providers , via alternate routes .
