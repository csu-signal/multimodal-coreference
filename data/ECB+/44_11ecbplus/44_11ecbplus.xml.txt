Hewlett - Packard makes another acquisition , chases IBM
Posted Nov 14th 2007 12 : 41PM
Hewlett - Packard Corp . ( NYSE : HPQ ) has opened up its checkbook once again .
This time , the world's largest tech company by sales announced that it will be buying EYP Mission Critical Facilities Inc .
That company , which provides data center consulting services , will become a division of HP for an undisclosed sum , according to sources .
Is this a move to compete more headily with tech giant IBM Corp . ( NYSE : IBM ) ?
It could certainly be seen that way .
HP's growing presence in providing data center services and contract consulting is the core of IBM's business model these days , now that the latter is out of the hardware business .
EYP provides design , technology planning and support for large data centers - - the kind that runs a large U . S . bank , credit card operation or manufacturing business .
This is right in IBM's territory , and the move should put HP in a more competitive position to challenge IBM as a premier provider of computing services consulting .
Does HP's Mark Hurd want to grow the company he leads into the biggest computing hardware and services manufacturing company the world has ever seen ?
In a word , yes .
