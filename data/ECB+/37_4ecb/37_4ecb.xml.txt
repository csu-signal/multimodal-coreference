A series of powerful earthquakes has shaken Indonesia 's remote eastern province of Papua , briefly triggering fears of a tsunami , officials have said .
A young girl was killed and dozens of others were seriously injured in the quakes , which also sent small tsunamis into Japan 's southeastern coast .
Panicked residents fled to higher ground as the first earthquake measuring 7.6 magnitude struck on Sunday about 135 kilometers from the main city of Manokwari , according to the US Geological Survey .
Power supplies were cut and commercial flights were cancelled after cracks appeared on the runway of the city 's airport .
Hengky Tewu , a hospital director , said a 10-year-old girl was killed at home when a wall collapsed and crushed her head .
At least 50 people were hospitalised for broken bones and head wounds while 300 others were given outpatient treatment , Henri Sembiring a local health official , said .
One of the tremors with a 7.3 magnitude was felt 1,300 kilometers away in northern Australia , but no damage was reported .
Indonesia 's National Disaster Coordination Agency said about 135 homes and other buildings were badly damaged or toppled in the quakes .
Residents in Manokwari - a jumble of low-lying brick and cement structures home to 167,000 people - remained wary of aftershocks , with many staying outdoors in case fresh tremors caused more buildings to collapse .
The Indonesian health ministry and World Vision Indonesia , a relief agency , have said they will be sending in aid teams and emergency kits including canned food , blankets and basic medical supplies .
Papua , located about 2,955 kilometers east of the country 's capital , Jakarta , is among the nation 's least developed areas .
In December 2004 , a massive undersea quake off the western Indonesian province of Aceh triggered a giant tsunami that left at least 230,000 people dead and missing in a dozen countries facing the Indian Ocean .
Indonesia straddles a chain of fault lines and volcanoes known as the Pacific `` ring of fire '' and is prone to seismic activity .
