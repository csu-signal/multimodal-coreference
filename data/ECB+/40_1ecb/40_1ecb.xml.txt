After weeks of speculation about what would be introduced at Macworld , Apple Inc. took the wraps off of updated iTunes and iLife software and unveiled a 17-inch MacBook Pro on Tuesday .
The Cupertino , Calif.-based company ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) said iTunes songs will now have three-tiered pricing : 69 cents , 99 cents and $ 1.29 , depending on how new or desirable the songs are judged to be .
All songs offered on iTunes Plus will be free of digital rights management software .
Users of the popular iTunes service will now also be able to download music over WiFi and 3G networks on the iPhone .
Apple claims that its new MacBook Pro is the thinnest and lightest 17-inch notebook computer available .
Its new battery can run for up to eight hours on a charge and can be rechagred up to 1,000 times , the company said .
The new notebook is expected to ship in late January with a price tag of $ 2,799 for the base model that will have 4 gigabytes of RAM and a 320 gigabyte hard drive .
The new version of iLife includes changes to its photo , movie and music software .
The updated iPhoto lets users tag photos according to who is in them or where they were taken .
The Places feature either picks up the tag from a camera 's GPS system or the information can be put in manually .
The new iPhoto software also supports photos tagging at social networking sites Facebook and Flickr .
The second revamped iLife offering unveiled at Apple 's keynote Tuesday morning was a new version of iMovie , which allows new drag-and-drop editing features , video stabilization , built-in themes and animated travel maps .
ILife 's new version of Garageband music software adds HD video tutorials for guitar and piano taught by pop stars including Sting and Norah Jones .
Apple also rolled out an updated version of iWork that includes a new online service that lets users share documents over the Web .
Delivering the keynote address at the Macworld trade show was Apple 's top marketing executive , Philip Schiller , who spoke in the place of CEO Steve Jobs .
On Monday Jobs ended weeks of new speculation about his health with an open letter saying that he has a hormonal imbalance that has caused him to lose weight .
Last month Apple said Jobs would n't be making his highly-anticipated annual appearance at the show , a report that renewed rumors about his health that surfaced when he appeared gaunt earlier in the year .
