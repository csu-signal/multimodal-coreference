The reigning national player of the year finished 7-for-14 from the field and had nine rebounds for North Carolina ( 10-0 ) , which shook off a slow start and stretched the lead to double figures shortly after Hansbrough passed Phil Ford for the record midway through the first half .

He set the record by muscling in a bank shot over two defenders with 7:41 to go .
Ty Lawson added 16 points for the Tar Heels , while Danny Green had 14 , including the 1,000th of his career .
