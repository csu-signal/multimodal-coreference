A Superior Court jurty in Norwalk today convicted a Hawaiian Gardens gang member of murdering L . A . County Sheriff's Deputy Jerry Ortiz in June , 2005 .
The District Attorney's office says in a release that the jury found Jose Luis Orozco , 29 , guilty of 1st degree murder , attempted murder and posession of a firearm by a felon .
It also found true special circumstances of murder of a police officer intentionally killed while performing his duties , murder to avoid arrest , street gang murder , lying in wait . . . and that Orozco personally used a handgun to commit the murder and the attempted murder , the D .

Sheriff Deputy Ortiz , 35 , with LASD's Gang Enforcement Unit , was killed June 24 , 2005 outside an apartment in the 12000 block of East 223rd Street in Hawaiian Gardens while investigating a June 20 shooting in which Orozco was a suspect .
