Lindsay Lohan Checks Out Of Rehab . . . To Check Into Different Rehab Centre
14 June 2013
The actress has left the Betty Ford Centre and gone to Malibu's Cliffside resort .
One place Lindsay is finding this particularly difficult though is at the Betty Ford Centre , where the actress has just finished 30 days' worth of treatment and has decided that the renowned facilities there won't be enough to keep her around for her court - ordered 90 - day stay in rehab , so she's gone elsewhere .
According to a report from TMZ published this week ( June 13 ) , the Mean Girls actress has had enough of the Palm Springs rehab centre and has decided to spend the rest of her court - ordered stay in a rehab centre in Malibu , named the Cliffside .
Lindsay hasn't messed around in getting to the new facility either and she is reportedly already a patient of the Cliffside rehab centre , having checked out of the Betty Ford Centre on Thursday ( June 13 ) this week and committing herself to Cliffside almost immediately afterward .
