July 03 , 2013 6 : 22AM
AN EARTHQUAKE killed six children and left 14 others trapped when a mosque collapsed during a Koran reading session in Indonesia's Aceh province , bringing the confirmed death toll from the disaster to 11 .
The strong 6 . 1 - magnitude quake left hundreds more injured as it rocked a region that was devastated by the quake - triggered tsunami of 2004 .
The earthquake reduced houses in parts of Aceh to rubble , set off several landslides and badly damaged roads .
Rescuers were struggling to find the children still trapped after the mosque collapse in Blang Mancung village , Central Aceh district .
"Our search and rescue teams are struggling to evacuate an estimated 14 children still trapped under the rubble , '' said Subhan Sahara , the head of the local disaster management agency .
"I hope they can be found alive but the chances are very slim , '' he added , explaining they were reading the Koran together when the quake struck .
The quake , which hit at a shallow depth of just 10 kilometres , injured more than 200 people and damaged more than 300 houses in Aceh , said national disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho .
As police and military personnel struggled to reach affected areas late Tuesday , there were two aftershocks of more than 5 . 0 magnitude .
In a village in Bener Meriah district , one man was killed when a landslide engulfed a coffee plantation , said disaster agency official Fauzi .
"A man was working at a coffee plantation with his wife when a landslide caused by the quake struck .
His body was found under a pile of earth soon afterwards , '' he said , adding that his wife and another woman were missing at the site .
Another four people died in hospitals in the district from injuries sustained in the quake , he said .
One of the fatalities was a child who died when a wall collapsed , said Ema Suryani , a doctor at a health clinic in Lampahan city in the district .
"We have received around 50 people with injuries sustained when the walls of their houses collapsed , '' added the doctor .
"There are around 30 people seriously injured , some with head injuries .
The rest have only light injuries like minor cuts and grazes . ''
Injured people had been transported from several affected villages in two trucks , she said .
People ran outside in Banda Aceh as the quake shook houses , and in Medan city to the south of the province on Sumatra island .
"The quake was felt strongly for around 15 seconds , from Bener Meriah to Banda Aceh .
People panicked and rushed out of their homes , '' said national disaster agency spokesman Nugroho .
Aceh , on the northern tip of Sumatra , is regularly hit by quakes .
In 2004 a massive tremor sparked a tsunami that killed 170 , 000 people in the province and tens of thousands more in countries around the Indian Ocean .
In April last year an 8 . 6 - magnitude quake struck 431 kilometres off Banda Aceh , prompting an Indian Ocean - wide tsunami alert .
Five people died and seven were injured in Aceh in the quake and following aftershocks .
In September 2009 a major earthquake near Padang city on Sumatra killed more than 1000 people .
Indonesia sits on the Pacific "Ring of Fire'' where tectonic plates collide , causing frequent seismic and volcanic activity .
