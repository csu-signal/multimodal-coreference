San Diego Chargers wide receiver Vincent Jackson was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence early Tuesday morning .
According to the San Diego Union-Tribune , Jackson was pulled over on state Route 52 just past 2:30 a.m. in the Clairemont section of San Diego , following an observed traffic violation .
He was booked and later released .
Jackson could be facing misdemeanors on the alleged DUI itself in addition to violating probation for a prior DUI charge .
Jackson released a statement through the team later Tuesday .
`` Yesterday I was stopped by an officer .
I do n't think any charges will be filed as a result of the stop .
In the event they are , I look forward to clearing my name and proving my innocence . ''
A fourth-year pro out of Northern Colorado , Jackson enjoyed a breakout year for the Chargers this season .
He set career-highs of 59 receptions , 1,098 yards and seven touchdowns .
San Diego knocked off the Indianapolis Colts , 23-17 , in last Saturday 's AFC Wild Card matchup after posting a 52-21 thumping over division rival Denver in a regular season finale that decided the AFC West champion .
The Chargers are getting set to take on the Pittsburgh Steelers Sunday in an AFC Divisional playoff tilt .
