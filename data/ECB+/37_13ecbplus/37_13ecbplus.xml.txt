Strong earthquake hits Indonesia's Aceh province
A strong earthquake struck off Indonesia's Aceh province on Tuesday , damaging houses and injuring at least five people .
The U . S . Geological Survey said the magnitude 6 . 1 quake struck at a depth of 10 kilometers ( 6 miles ) and its epicenter was located 55 kilometers ( 34 miles ) west of the town of Bireun on the western tip of Sumatra island .
At least five people were reportedly injured and 10 houses were damaged in Takengon , the capital of Central Aceh district , said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho of the National Disaster Mitigation Agency .
"I see many houses were damages and their roofs fell onto some people , " said Bensu Elianita , a 22 year - old resident in Bukit Sama village in Central Aceh district .
"Many people were injured but it is difficult to evacuate them due to traffic jams . "
She said many people in the village ran out from their houses in panic and screamed for help .
At least two houses were totally flattened , she said , adding that the quake also caused blackout in the village .
Indonesia is prone to seismic upheaval due to its location on the Pacific Ring of Fire , an arc of volcanoes and fault lines encircling the Pacific Ocean .
In 2004 , a huge earthquake off Aceh triggered a tsunami that killed 230 , 000 people across Asia .
