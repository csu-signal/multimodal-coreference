An explosion at a bank killed a police officer and a state bomb disposal technician , officials said Saturday , offering a $ 35,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction in the case .
`` That person is dangerous and needs to be found as soon as possible , '' said Oregon State Police Lt. Gregg Hastings .
The explosion occurred Friday afternoon at a West Coast Bank branch office in the agricultural town of Woodburn .
Police went to check on a telephoned bomb treat received by a nearby Wells Fargo branch bank and found a suspicious device , but that device turned out to be harmless .
But police said the investigation led them to the nearby West Coast office where the bomb was found by a bank employee in the bushes outside the building , and it exploded after officers took it inside .
Hastings did not know why the officers took it inside .
Police Capt. Tom Tennant and state Senior Trooper William Hakim , both 51 , died at the scene .
Police Chief Scott Russell , 46 , was injured and was in stable but critical condition .
The inside of the bank suffered extensive damage , and a female employee was treated at a hospital and released , police said .
Another bank employee was uninjured .
Police had no motive for the bombing and could offer no details about the bomb other than to say it was as powerful .
