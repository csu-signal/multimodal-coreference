Australian , English climbers killed in New Zealand
SEPTEMBER 16 , 2013 11 : 12AM
ONE Australian and one English climber have fallen to their deaths in New Zealand , police confirmed today .
Police Inspector Dave Gaskin said the two incidents on consecutive days in the Aoraki - Mt . Cook National Park were not related and were not due to bad weather .
He said they come as a reminder that climbers need to use extreme caution .
On Friday , 36 - year - old Duncan Rait died after slipping and falling about 60m from a ridge near the Tasman Glacier .
The New Zealand - born Australian was planning to do some ski touring .
He'd been dropped off by helicopter with a group and was walking to a hut when he fell , sliding down a steep slope and over a cliff .
Gaskin said that other climbers attempted to rescue Rait by taking him down the glacier , but that he died on the way down .
On Saturday , 32 - year - old Englishman Robert Buckley fell about 600m while climbing to a small hut on Mount Sefton with three companions .
Gaskin said Buckley was wearing crampons but was inexperienced .
