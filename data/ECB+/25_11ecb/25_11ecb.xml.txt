The New Orleans Saints placed Reggie Bush on the injured list on Wednesday , ending the National Football League season for the star running back .
The 23-year-old Bush will miss the team 's final two regular season games against Detroit and Carolina with a sprained left knee .
Bush finished his third season in New Orleans with just 404 yards and two touchdowns on 106 carries .
Bush suffered a left knee injury against Carolina on October 19 .
He appeared to be on the mend , but he sprained the knee in last Thursday 's 27-24 overtime loss at Chicago and was limited to only 30 yards on six carries .
