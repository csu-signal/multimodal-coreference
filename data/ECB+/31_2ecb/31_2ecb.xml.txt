Top-ranked North Carolina waited for Tyler Hansbrough to make history , then cruised to its latest lopsided victory .
Hansbrough scored 20 points last night to break the storied program 's career scoring record and help the Tar Heels ( 10-0 ) remain unbeaten with a 91-73 victory over visiting Evansville ( 7-2 ) .
The reigning National Player of the Year passed Phil Ford for the record midway through the first half .
Ford , now an assistant coach to fellow Tar Heel alumnus Larry Brown with the NBA Charlotte Bobcats , finished his career in 1978 with 2,290 points .
As soon as the record-setting shot went through the net , officials briefly stopped the game to allow Ford , coach Roy Williams and athletic director Dick Baddour to present Hansbrough with the game ball .
`` I never dreamed I 'd be here and be the all-time leading scorer , '' Hansbrough said as he stood alone at midcourt after the game .
`` This is a great honor to be here and to represent you guys every night in this uniform . ''
Shy Ely scored 23 points for the Purple Aces .
