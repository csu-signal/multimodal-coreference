The case first captured the nation 's attention when Laci Peterson disappeared from her Modesto home the day before Christmas 2002 and has engrossed the country ever since .
Unlike on Nov. 12 , when sobs filled the air as Peterson was found guilty of murdering his wife and their unborn child , there was an almost surreal stillness in the courtroom while the death recommendation was announced .
Peterson was convicted Nov. 12 of first-degree murder for the death of Laci Peterson and second-degree murder for the death of their unborn son just before Christmas 2002 .
The same jury that recommended Peterson 's penalty found him guilty of the first-degree murder of his wife and the second-degree murder of his unborn child .
