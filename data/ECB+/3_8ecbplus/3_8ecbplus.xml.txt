Escape renews calls for prison agency shake - up
November 30 , 2009
After facing serious questions about how 900 prohibited cell phones were smuggled into Texas prisons this year , along with drugs and weapons , the Texas Department of Criminal Justice found itself on the defensive again Tuesday while trying to find an inmate who escaped despite being shackled to a wheelchair .
TDCJ officials could answer few questions about how convicted rapist Arcade Joseph Comeaux Jr . , 49 , escaped Monday from a prison van in Baytown after pulling a gun and handcuffing two transport officers , stealing their three guns and walking away .
He remains on the loose today .
Comeaux escaped Monday morning as transport officers tried to move him in a TDCJ van from the Estelle prison unit in Huntsville to the Stiles Unit in Beaumont .
He put on one officer's gray uniform and black boots , then stole a 12 - gauge shotgun and two semi - automatic pistols before fleeing on foot , leaving his pistol behind .
