Tue Jul 02 2013 , 14 : 58 hrs
A strong 6 . 1 - magnitude earthquake struck Indonesia's northwestern province of Aceh today , causing buildings to collapse and injuring at least 50 people .
The quake hit inland at 0737 GMT at a depth of just 10 kilometres , 55 kilometres south of Bireun and 72 kilometres southeast of Reuleuet , the US Geological Survey said .
"We have received around 50 people with injuries suffered when the walls of their houses collapsed , " Ema Suryani , a doctor at a health clinic in Lampahan city , Bener Meriah district , told AFP .
"The injuries vary from open wounds to broken bones . "
Injured people had been transported from several affected villages in two trucks , she said .
People also ran out of buildings in panic in the provincial capital Banda Aceh as the quake shook houses for around one minute , an AFP journalist at the scene said .
A massive quake struck off Aceh in 2004 , sparking a tsunami that killed 170 , 000 people in the province on Sumatra and tens of thousands more in countries around the Indian Ocean .
Indonesia sits on the Pacific "Ring of Fire" where continental plates collide , causing frequent seismic and volcanic activity .
