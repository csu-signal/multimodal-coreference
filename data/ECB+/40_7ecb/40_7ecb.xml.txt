Apple Inc on Tuesday ( Jan 6 ) introduced what it claims to be the world 's thinnest and lightest 17-inch laptop with a new unibody aluminium enclosure and a built-in battery said to deliver up to eight hours of use and a lifespan three times longer than conventional laptop batteries .
It also announced a revamp of its iLife suite of digital lifestyle software at the Macworld Expo trade show here , in particular the iPhoto photo management software which now comes with face detection technology and built-in support for Facebook .
Consumers can also teach themselves to play musical instruments with the new version of GarageBand music creation software .
Conspicuously missing from this year 's expo is the company 's iconic CEO Steve Jobs , who is recuperating from a health problem .
His place as keynote presenter was taken over by vice-president of worldwide product marketing Phil Schiller .
In a two hour-long keynote , Schiller showcased the star attraction of the expo , the top-of-the-line 17-inch Apple MacBook Pro that now features a design similar to Apple 's two other laptops , the 13-inch MacBook and the 15-inch MacBook Pro .
Its body , carved out of a single block of aluminium , measures just 2.5cm thick .
The laptop weighs less than 2.99kg .
A high resolution , low power consumption LED-backlit display and a large button-less trackpad made of glass has now made its way into the laptop as well .
A new built-in battery powers the laptop for eight hours on a single charge .
Touted as the greenest notebook family , the new MacBook Pro 's battery allows up to 1,000 recharges for more than three times the lifespan of conventional laptop batteries .
The typical lifespan for laptop batteries is about three years .
The new 17-inch MacBook Pro will retail in Malaysia for RM10,099 .
iPhoto , one of five digital lifestyle software in the iLife 09 suite now , has new features called Places and Faces .
Places automatically imports photo location data from a GPS-enabled camera or an Apple iPhone , while with Faces , iPhoto automatically scans photos to detect people 's faces and when names are assigned to those faces , iPhoto will find more pictures of that person .
Taking things a step further , a button in iPhoto enables not just convenient publishing of photos on photo sharing websites such as Facebook and Flickr , but also to detect even more faces on the Internet .
Calling them `` really powerful '' , Schiller demonstrated how these features help organise thousands of photos .
The updated GarageBand 09 allows budding musicians to learn to play the piano and guitar at their own pace .
Basic Lessons allow newbies to learn the fundamentals while a feature called Artist Lessons has original artists including John Fogerty , Colbie Caillat , Norah Jones and Sting showing how to play their hit songs .
`` iLife has become one of the reasons people buy a Mac today .
There 's nothing like it on any other computing platform , '' said Schiller .
Priced at RM299 for single user , iLife 09 will ship end of January .
Also announced at Macworld were updates to the company 's iWork office productivity suite .
Called iWork 09 , the three software that makes up the suite , namely Keynote , Pages and Numbers have received new themes , sophisticated transition effects and a quick way to group and summarise data .
iWork 09 is available immediately for RM299 .
The `` one more thing '' announcement -- Jobs ' trademark way of announcing something unexpected -- was reserved for a new three-tier pricing for Apple 's iTunes online music store which is not available in Malaysia .
Jobs , who survived a pancreatic cancer in 2004 and appeared to be losing weight throughout 2008 , on Monday ( Jan 5 ) wrote a personal letter addressed to the Apple community , saying doctors have pinpointed hormone imbalance as the reason for his illness .
`` The remedy for this nutritional problem is relatively simple and straightforward , and I 've already begun treatment , '' he wrote , adding that he would remain as Apple 's CEO and expects to be back in shape by Spring this year .
