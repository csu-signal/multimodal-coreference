South Sudan warns of war after Sudan bombs refugee camp
Military aircraft from Sudan crossed the new international border with South Sudan and dropped bombs Thursday in and around a camp filled with refugees , officials said .
A government official initially reported deaths , but an American activist who spoke to aid workers at the camp later said there were no casualties .
The violence in and near the Yida refugee camp , located 10 miles south of the border , came one day after bombings were reported in another region of South Sudan , an attack that provoked strong condemnation from the U . S . State Department .
The president of South Sudan , which became the world's newest country only four months ago , said he fears the Khartoum - based government intends to invade the south soon .
"Whatever allegations Khartoum labels against the Republic of South Sudan are baseless , but intended to justify his pending invasion of the south , " President Salva Kiir said .
He later added : "We are committed to peaceful resolutions to any conflict but we will never allow our sovereignty to be violated by anybody . "
There was no immediate comment from the Sudanese government in Khartoum on Thursday .
The violence is especially troubling given the history between the two sides : The black African tribes of South Sudan and the mainly Arab north battled two civil wars over more than five decades , and some 2 million died in the latest war , from 1983 - 2005 .
A peace deal ended the war and South Sudan became its own country in July after a successful independence referendum .
But there have been lingering disputes over border demarcation and oil - sharing revenues .
Ryan Boyette , a former aid worker who lives in Sudan who is now leading a team of 15 citizen journalists , said he talked to five aid workers in the Yida camp , all of whom said that four bombs were dropped but that they caused no casualties .
