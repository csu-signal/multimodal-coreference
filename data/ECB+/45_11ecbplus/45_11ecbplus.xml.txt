A jury in eastern Oklahoma has convicted a Spiro man of two counts of first - degree murder in the 2012 shooting death of his pregnant girlfriend .
The jury deliberated almost seven hours Thursday before convicting 27 - year - old Christopher Kenyon Simpson in the death of 20 - year - old Ka'loni Flynn of Fort Smith , Ark .
The Southwest Times Record reports that the jury recommended the maximum sentence of life in prison without parole .
Formal sentencing is set for 11 a . m . on Nov . 8 .
Prosecutors allege that Simpson shot Flynn twice in the head because he did not want another child to support .
A DNA expert testified that Simpson fathered the fetus .
Simpson's attorney , Warren Gotcher , argued that no witnesses could place Simpson at the shooting scene and that his client was innocent .
