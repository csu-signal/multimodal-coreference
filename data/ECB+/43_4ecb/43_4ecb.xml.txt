Advanced Micro Devices Inc. shook up the personal computer industry by buying ATI Technologies Inc. for US $ 5.4-billion yesterday , opening up a new front in the battle with Intel Corp. to control the computer chip market .
The deal , which had been anticipated for over a year , gives AMD high-end graphics technology and bolsters the company 's strategy to overtake Intel as the dominant supplier of chips that power personal computers and other devices .
As well , Intel has been a buyer of ATI 's graphic chips and that relationship looks to be in jeopardy .
`` This reconfigures the market and puts AMD in an amazingly new strong position , '' said Jon Peddie , an independent chip analyst in San Francisco .
