26-year-old Matt Smith has been cast as the next incarnation of the Doctor .
Users on the Facebook Doctor Who forum that I frequent mostly had the same reaction : `` Who 's Matt Smith ? ''
The guy is relatively unknown and the skeptics wondered if the right person was chosen .
After all , everyone speculated that Paterson Joseph , who had appeared on a couple episodes of the show , was going to be the next Doctor and here we get some no-name .
