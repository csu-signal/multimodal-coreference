Chris Weitz is in negotiations to helm `` New Moon , '' the sequel to Summit Entertainment 's vampire breakout `` Twilight . ''
Weitz comes on board to helm the second installment in Stephenie Meyer 's four-book series after Summit and `` Twilight '' director Catherine Hardwicke failed to reach a deal on the new movie .
The Weitz move prompted a carefully calibrated campaign of reassurance on the part of creators .
Meyer penned a letter that sought to calm fans nervous about the midstream switch .
`` I 'm sad that Catherine is not continuing on with us for 'New Moon , ' she wrote in a letter on her Web site , but then noted that , with Weitz:
`` Torches and pitchforks are n't going to be necessary . ''
The director `` is excited by the story and eager to keep the movie as close to the book as possible , '' she wrote .
`` He is also aware of you , the fans , and wants to keep you all extremely happy .
It 's rare for the director of a successful first picture not to continue on with the sequel .
There have been conflicting reports about Hardwicke 's departure , with some noting creative and other differences .
Summit has said it was a matter of scheduling .
Weitz has not helmed a girl-oriented project before but has been involved in movies that encompass elements featured in `` Twilight , '' producing the teen-aimed coming-of-age tale `` American Pie '' and directing the fantasy adventure `` The Golden Compass . ''
Still , the director was taking few chances .
`` I promise to remain responsive to your hopes and fears , '' he wrote in his own letter to fans Saturday .
`` I thank you for this opportunity and for your faith . ''
Weitz said he had been `` in a whirlwind romance '' with the series over the past few days , and , in a particularly careful phrasing , said he is `` very grateful to have received ( Meyer 's ) permission to protect 'New Moon ' in its translation from the page to the screen . ''
Both Weitz 's and Meyer 's letters represent rare attempts to communicate with fans on issues often left mostly to the industry , and speak both to the intense insider interest of fans as well as the importance of that group to the franchise 's success .
Summit a week ago had faced a public-relations challenge when some fan bulletin boards began to worry about Hardwicke 's departure .
Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart will star in `` Moon , '' while Melissa Rosenberg is writing the picture which , like the first , centers on the ordinary teenager Bella and the vampire Edward but adds Jacob , a werewolf character who figured less prominently in the first film .
The budget for `` Moon '' is expected to be slightly higher than the first in the franchise , with a release likely for late 2009 or early 2010 .
