New Orleans Saints place Pierre Thomas on injured reserve list
The New Orleans Saints have placed running back Pierre Thomas on the injured reserve list a day after their leading rusher , Chris Ivory , was shut down for the season .
With a playoff game looming Saturday on what probably will be a wet field in a tough stadium in Seattle , Reggie Bush and Julius Jones will step up to replace the Saints' top two running backs .
"I don't know that this is a rallying cry , " Coach Sean Payton said of the injuries ( via Jeff Duncan of the Times - Picayune ) .
"We've gone through this before .
It's not uncommon .
It's more the norm . "
Thomas had a setback with an ankle injury in practice last week and , Payton said , everyone "felt this was the best move . "
The Saints signed DeShawn Wynn on Tuesday and Joique Bell today off the Philadelphia Eagles' practice squad .
