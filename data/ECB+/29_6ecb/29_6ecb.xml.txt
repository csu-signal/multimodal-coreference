Manning on the money , Colts lock up 5th seed
Locking up the No. 5 seed in the AFC playoffs , Peyton Manning completed 29-of-34 passes for 364 yards and three touchdowns to lead the Colts over the Jaguars in Week 16 .
Manning was feeling it tonight .
He completed his first 17 passes , all of them on the money as he methodically took the Jags defense apart .
Firing beautiful pass after beautiful pass , this was vintage Peyton in his best game of the season -- and quite possibly the most accurate performance of his illustrious career .
Manning has the Indy passing game well-tuned for the playoffs , but he 's likely to close out the season on the bench next week .
If so , his late-season flourish leaves him with 3,907 yards and 26 touchdowns in 15 games. Dec. 18 - 11:14 pm et
