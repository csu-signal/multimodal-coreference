Klitschko stops Thompson in regulation win
July 7 , 2012
Wladimir Klitschko retained his IBF , WBO , WBA & IBO heavyweight world titles with a second professional victory over Tony Thompson on Saturday .
Klitschko , 36 , stopped the 40 - year - old Thompson with two seconds remaining of the sixth round in Switzerland to retain his collection of titles .
In 2008 , last time the pair met , the bout went 11 rounds before the Ukrainian emerged triumphant .
Klitschko dumped Thompson onto the canvas with a booming right end towards the end of the fifth round of the fight in Bern , and from then on it was simply a matter of time before referee Sam Williams stopped matters .
The decisive moment came at the end of the next three - minute stretch , the same punch again bringing Thompson to his knees and - despite beating the count - he was clearly too unsteady to continue .
Klitschko , who could face Tyson Fury in the near future after being called out by the British - Irish fighter , improves to a career record of 58 wins and three defeats .
