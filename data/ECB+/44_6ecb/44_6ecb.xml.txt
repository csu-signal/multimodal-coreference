Impact of EDS merger on South Charleston unclear
It 's too early to tell what impact - if any - Hewlett-Packard Co. 's decision to acquire Electronic Data Systems Corp. will have on EDS ' operations in South Charleston , an EDS spokesman said .
Earlier this month Hewlett-Packard unveiled a bid of nearly $ 14 billion bid to purchase EDS .
EDS has about 50 employees in Building 6000 at the South Charleston Technology Park .
The workers manage the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development 's computer network of more than 18,000 users in more than 80 locations .
EDS won the 10-year contract in 2003 .
Bill Ritz , EDS spokesman , pointed out that Hewlett-Packard 's acquisition of EDS still needs the approval of regulators and EDS ' stockholders .
`` The deal is supposed to close sometime in the second half of 2008 , '' Ritz said .
`` Until it closes , both companies are competitors and it will be business as usual .
We will continue to put our customers first and serve them and help them compete in the global marketplace . ''
Any cuts in staff are pure speculation at this point , Ritz said .
`` A lot of work still needs to be done , '' he said .
`` We need to let this play out and keep the focus on our customers and remember we are separate companies now . ''
