I confirmed yesterday that Obama has offered the job and that Gupta had all but officially accepted .
Got it up on the Web site at 2:36 p.m. , mere moments after filing the story .
Cyberspeed comes in handy sometimes .
CNN , where I host a weekly program , did n't report it until 3:59 , but the blogs went crazy -- lead story on HuffPost , top of Drudge 's page , then the NYT and others .
Gupta would n't comment to me -- while not denying the story -- but confirmed on his Twitter feed that he `` has been approached by the Obama administration about the U.S. surgeon general 's post . ''
Everyone 's digital these days .
It 's interesting that Obama was so intent on recruiting him that he met with the `` House Call '' host for 2 1/2 hours on Nov. 25 .
He seems to want an administration of stars in the Hillary mode .
Gupta does n't have a Panetta problem -- he operates inside people 's heads , after all -- and has always been drawn to health policy , since a stint in the Clinton White House .
