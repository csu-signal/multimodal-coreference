RIM and T-Mobile USA have finally gone official with the BlackBerry Curve 8900 , just one day after the smartphone was seen in one of T-Mo 's retail stores .
So now we know for sure that the new Curve will be commercially available starting February , although an exact release date and a price were not given yet .
The 8900 is the thinnest BlackBerry ever built ( only 13.5 mm ) , and it 's also among the best looking smartphones to come form RIM .
Add Wi-Fi , GPS , a 3.2MP autofocus camera and a nice 480 x 360 pixels display to that and you have a really cool handset .
The only thing that the Curve 8900 is missing is 3G , but since T-Mobile does n't have a nationwide 3G coverage yet , I guess this is not such a big problem .
While waiting for the new Berry to be available , you can enter a T-Mobile contest here , and maybe you 'll win one for free .
