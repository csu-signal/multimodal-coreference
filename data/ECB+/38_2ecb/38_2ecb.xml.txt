A 4.2 magnitude earthquake shook a remote area of eastern Sonoma County on Sunday morning , the largest in a flurry over the weekend , according to the U.S. Geological Survey .
The temblor occurred at 9:27 a.m. , 13 miles east of Cloverdale and 2 miles southeast of The Geysers , where geothermal forces by more than 20 power plants are harnessed to provide energy for several North Bay counties .
According to the USGS , the area has no fault , but the pumping of water from plants into the ground periodically induces small temblors .
The size of Sunday morning 's earthquake caught the attention of people in Cobb , a small community along Highway 175 in Lake County , 4 miles east of The Geysers .
`` Shaking is n't uncommon here , but this was a pretty good jolt , '' said James Gaskell , manager of Hardester 's grocery .
The only products to fall off shelves were Q-Tip boxes and mayonnaise , but `` our wine rattled pretty good . ''
Down the road at Brick Oven Pizza , which opens for breakfast on weekends , `` it caught our attention , '' said Geri Angel , a waitress .
`` We have teacup rattlers all the time , but pans were swinging for this one . ''
