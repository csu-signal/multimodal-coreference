On Monday , we reported on rumors that T-Mobile would release the RIM BlackBerry Curve 8900 on February 11 , and while the date has not been confirmed , the carrier did go ahead and make the official product announcement on Tuesday .
Yes , the BlackBerry Curve 8900 will make its way to T-Mobile some time in February and is being touted as the thinnest and lightest full QWERTY BlackBerry to date .
As expected , it will have integrated Bluetooth and GPS and we now know it will have built-in Wi-Fi as well as support for T-Mobile 's Unlimited HotSpot Calling service .
Unfortunately , there is no 3G love .
There are plenty of other highlights , though , including a 3.2-megapixel camera , a 3.5mm headphone jack , a microSD/SDHC expansion slot ( supports up to 16GB cards ) , and a 512MHz processor .
Pricing and an official release date were not released , but customers can sign up for alerts on T-Mobile 's Web site .
