T - Mobile US Confirms They Will Carry the BlackBerry Q10
on April 24th , 2013
We can expect more carriers to be coming out talking about the Q10 but T - Mobile is the first in the US .
They just confirmed that they will carry the device though they said nothing about availability and pricing .
They did say that after April 29th business customers will be able to register for the Q10 at this link .
My guess is they will open up preorders for business customers about 2 weeks before normal launch .
Here is how they describe the device :
T - Mobile USA continues to add to its growing 4G LTE smartphone portfolio with the BlackBerry� Q10 .
The BlackBerry Q10 combines BlackBerry's classic QWERTY keyboard and a touch screen with the power of the BlackBerry� 10 platform that delivers all the speed and connectivity customers demand to help them keep moving .
T - Mobile customers can take advantage of the BlackBerry Q10 smartphone's premium hardware , advanced communications and multimedia features on a blazing - fast nationwide 4G network .
"With the powerful combination of BlackBerry's new BlackBerry 10 platform , the company's long - standing security features and BlackBerry's best QWERTY keyboard , the BlackBerry Q10 will be another great smartphone option for our business customers , " said Drew Kelton , executive vice president of business markets at T - Mobile .
