Jim O'Brien was terminated from his position as head men's basketball coach at Ohio State University following the disclosure that he loaned a recruit's mother money .
O'Brien sued , claiming he was terminated without cause , and both parties filed motions for summary judgment .
The court of claims denied the motions because there was a factual dispute concerning what constituted a material breach under the employment contract .
