Trial is set for June 17 for 26 - year - old Christopher Kenyon Simpson of Fort Coffee , who is accused of fatally shooting Ka'Loni Marie Flynn of Fort Smith , Ark .
The Southwest Times Record reports Simpson has been held without bond at the LeFlore County Jail since his arrest on June 21 .
Flynn's body was found in a car near Spiro on April 9 .
