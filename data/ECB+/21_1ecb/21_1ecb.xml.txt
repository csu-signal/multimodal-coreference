Police arrest suspect in fatal Bloomington hit and run
The driver allegedly hit a 66-year-old woman near a Bloomington parking lot and fled the scene .
Police said alcohol was a factor .
A woman hit and killed by a motorist Wednesday night outside a Sam 's Club store in Bloomington might be alive if the driver had listened to bystanders who frantically pleaded with him to stop .
LuAnn Marie Johnson , 66 , of Burnsville , was walking into the store at 200 W. American Blvd. with her husband when she was struck just after 7 p.m. , said Sgt. Marty Earley .
She was in a marked crosswalk when the car hit her .
The impact knocked Johnson to the ground .
As she lay in front of the motorist 's vehicle , a man standing next to her screamed , `` No , no , no ! '' and tried to get the driver to stay put .
Instead , the driver gunned the engine and drove over Johnson , hitting her and dragging her 10 feet as he sped away , said witness Angela Benson , who had just exited the store with her two young sons and was 20 feet away .
`` It was horrible to see , '' said Benson , a managing editor at WCCO-TV , Ch. 4 .
`` He took off like a bullet .
People were just screaming . ''
Johnson was taken to Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis , where she died .
After hitting her , the suspect sideswiped a parked vehicle before leaving the parking lot and heading west on American Boulevard .
Police stopped Anthony Phillip LaSalle , 36 , of Bloomington , when he hit another vehicle at the intersection of American Boulevard and Lyndale Avenue .
They used a Taser to subdue him .
LaSalle was arrested and booked into the Bloomington city jail , Earley said .
He is now being held in the Hennepin County jail on probable cause for criminal vehicular operation .
Police were still gathering statements from several witnesses Thursday morning , but `` we do know alcohol was a factor , '' Earley said .
LaSalle is expected to be charged today , Earley said .
