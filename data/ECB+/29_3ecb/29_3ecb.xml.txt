Colts Top Jags To Make Playoffs
The Indianapolis Colts will be making their seventh straight playoff appearance after securing that spot with a 31-24 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars last night in Jacksonville .
The Colts ( 11-4 ) also won their eighth straight game in defeating the Jags ( 5-10 ) who raced out to an early 14-0 lead in the game .
In fact , the Colts did n't take their first lead until former Gator defensive back Keiwan Ratliff intercepted a David Garrard pass and returned it for a touchdown to give the Colts a 31-24 lead .
The Jags drove down to the Colts 7 yard line but a pass to running back Maurice Jones-Drew was completed and he hurt his knee on the play .
The Jags had no timeouts left and by injury rule at that time a 10 second clock runoff was instituted and the game ended .
