Paris hit by 2 mn - euro jewelry heist
Four men rammed their car into an upmarket jewelry store in central Paris on Monday , smashing the shop window and making off with a two - million - euro ( $2 . 6 - million ) booty , a police source said .
The heist near the upscale Place Vendome is the latest to hit France after a spate of high - profile robberies in the southern resort of Cannes .
The police source , who wished to remain anonymous , said the men drove a large four - by - four car into the store in the early hours of the morning and grabbed jewelry and luxury watches worth an estimated two million euros .
They then set fire to the vehicle and escaped in another car .
Forensic policemen are currently going through the site of the robbery at the Casty store on Rue de Castiglione in the central first district of Paris , which is home to numerous jewelry shops .
At the end of July , an armed man carried out a brazen robbery in broad daylight at a diamond exhibition at the Carlton hotel in Cannes , making off with jewelry worth 103 million euros in one of the world's biggest ever heists .
Paris has also been the scene of high - profile robberies .
In December 2008 , three men emptied almost all of the stock of gems from the Harry Winston jewelry store .
In 2009 , police said they had recovered 80 percent of the haul .
