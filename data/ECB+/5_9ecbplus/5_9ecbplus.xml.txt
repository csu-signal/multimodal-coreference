Agent says Sixers to sign Dalembert to six - year deal
July 25 , 2005 , 12 : 18 AM ET
Samuel Dalembert agreed to a six year deal with the Philadelphia 76ers on Saturday , his agent Marc Cornstein , told ESPN . com .
Cornstein refused to disclose the amount of the contract , but it's believed to be worth between $60 million to $70 million , based on previous negotiations .
The signing came just one day before Dalembert was set to get on a plane and visit the Atlanta Hawks , who had the money under the cap to pay him a maximum five - year , $70 million offer .
Of the three top big men on the market , Dalembert was the center with the most upside .
He has great range and is athletic , with great shot blocking instincts .
He's shown he can be a volume rebounder and his offensive game is emerging .
He was very inconsistent at times this season , but in the playoffs against the Detroit Pistons , he played the part of a franchise center .
The Sixers made a power move this offseason , firing head coach Jim O'Brien , who wasn't a Dalembert fan , and replacing him with Mo Cheeks , who is .
Philly let it be known that O'Brien was fired , in part , because the Sixers are committed to Dalembert .
This is the third deal for the Sixers this summer .
They also reached six - year deals with Kyle Korver for $25 million and with Willie Green for about $20 million .
