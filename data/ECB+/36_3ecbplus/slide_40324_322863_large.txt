A truck hauling lumber makes it way to a compound being constructed by members of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints led by Warren Jeffs, near Eldorado, Texas, March 1, 2005. The new complex just north of Eldorado, about 160 miles northwest of San Antonio, includes about a dozen concrete and log apartment buildings plus other structures around the estimated 80-foot tall fortress-like temple shown at the top that is nearing completion.
