This Dec.1, 2010 file photo provided by the Reagan County (Texas) Sheriff's Department, shows Warren Jeffs, leader of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. Members of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints _ a radical offshoot of mainstream Mormonism that believes polygamy is the key to heaven _ were subject of a SWAT team raid where 439 children were seized from mothers and Jeffs, and 11 other sect members, are facing charges including sexual assault and bigamy.
