A former employee who opened fire at an office Christmas party and killed one man has been charged with first-degree murder , police said Saturday .
Constable Tim Fanning allege the recently- fired man , Eric Allen Kirkpatrick , 61 , opened fire at a Vancouver office Friday , killing Benjamin David Banky , 40 .
Fanning said the gunman entered the party of at least a dozen people around 4 p.m .
One man was shot and killed but the other partygoers managed to escape and no one else was injured .
`` Police 'locked down ' the neighborhood and negotiated with the suspect , who gave himself up to police just after 6 p.m. , '' Fanning said in a statement .
The business at the location of the shooting is listed as TallGrass Distribution Ltd. , a natural health product supplier .
Luke Pigeon , who lives in an apartment building next door , said he did n't hear a gunshot but heard noise outside his window .
`` It was n't typical , crazy noise that sometimes happens .
You got the feeling there was something definitely , definitely wrong , '' Pigeon told The Canadian Press .
He looked out his window and saw someone fleeing the building next door .
`` All of a sudden in my front yard there were five totally decked out , geared up riot squad officers with guns out of the holster , aiming at the second floor of the building right beside us , '' Pigeon said .
After two hours , he said , the gunman gave himself up and police cuffed him .
