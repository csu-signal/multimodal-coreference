In case you had any doubts whether or not Pierre Thomas ( left ) would get more carries than Reggie Bush , you can now have full faith in Thomas .
After spraining his knee last week at Chicago , Bush has been placed on the injured reserve list ending his season .
Hello , Mr. Thomas. Owners have been worried that Thomas ' carries would be affected by Bush 's return , but those worries are all for naught .
With Bush completely out of the picture , Thomas is the lone back and could capitalize in a big way in his two remaining games .
Remember , Thomas is still playing for a contract .
The Saints take on the 0-14 Lions , and it appears the Saints will march into Motown and hand them No. 15 .
The Lions have the league 's worst rushing defense , and teams do n't need to throw a lot because offenses are able to run wild .
Good news for Pierre owners .
Thomas is an elite RB going forward , and those of you lucky enough to nab him should reap the benefits. Make sure he 's in your lineups for championship weeks .
Since Week 11 , Thomas has eight touchdowns on 498 rushing yards and 176 receiving yards .
Not bad for a late waiver-wire guy , huh ?
As far as Bush is concerned , the Saints are erring on the side of caution regarding the injury .
With the playoffs out of the picture , there 's no need to worsen the injury .
He 'll be a top PPR running back in 2009 .
