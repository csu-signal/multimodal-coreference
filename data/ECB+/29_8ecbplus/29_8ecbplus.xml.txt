Colts Clinch Playoff Berth with 20 - 13 Win Over Chiefs
Posted on : 3 : 35 pm , December 23 , 2012
Despite rushing for 352 yards , the Kansas City Chiefs lost their home finale to the Indianapolis Colts at Arrowhead Stadium on Sunday afternoon .
The Colts ( 10 - 5 , 4 - 4 away ) owned the NFL ’ s worst record last year , and clinched a spot in the playoffs with Sunday ’ s win .
With 4 : 08 to play in the fourth quarter , rookie quarterback Andrew Luck found wide receiver Reggie Wayne for a seven - yard touchdown pass , capping the 73 - yard game winning drive .
Luck also set a new record for most single - season passing yards by a rookie in the process .
Carolina Panthers QB Cam Newton held the previous record at 4 , 051 yards .
The Chiefs ( 2 - 13 , 1 - 7 home ) almost got to play the role of the Grinch in Chiefs red .
However , a Chiefs win would ’ ve likely cost them the first overall pick in the 2013 NFL Draft .
The Chiefs are currently in line for the first overall pick , owning the tiebreaker over the Jacksonville Jaguars ( 2 - 13 ) .
After holding Indianapolis to three and out to start the game , Chiefs QB Brady Quinn threw a pick six to cornerback Darius Butler , who returned the interception 32 yards for a TD .
The Chiefs went on a 68 - yard drive midway through the second quarter , but the drive was halted when running back Jamaal Charles lost a fumble on the Colts 16 - yard line .
Indy led 13 - 3 at the half , but Kansas City opened up the second half in a big way .
On the first play from scrimmage , Charles broke off an 86 - yd TD run to trim the deficit to 13 - 10 .
The Chiefs went on a 67 - yd drive on their next possession , but CB Vontae Davis intercepted Quinn ’ s pass in the end zone .
Kicker Ryan Succop tied the game at 13 - 13 with a 47 - yd field goal with 10 : 03 to play in the third quarter , and it stayed that way until the Colts ’ game winning drive in the fourth .
Charles ’ 226 yards rushing was good for the third most in a single game in franchise history .
He also holds spots one and two on the all - time list .
RB Peyton Hillis rushed for 101 yards .
The Chiefs racked up a total of 507 yards on offense .
The Chiefs will play their season finale against the Denver Broncos next Sunday afternoon at Sports Authority Field at Mile High .
