Wednesday , July 28 , 2004
Fred LaRue , a Watergate figure and high - ranking Nixon administration official who once was rumored to be Deep Throat , has died of natural causes .
He was 75 .
His body was discovered Tuesday by a maid who entered his hotel room in Biloxi , Coroner Gary Hargrove said .
LaRue was known as the "bagman" who delivered payoffs to keep participants in the Watergate break - in quiet , and served 41 / 2 months in federal prison for conspiracy to obstruct justice .
LaRue served as special assistant to John Mitchell , the former attorney general who later headed President Nixon's re - election committee .
LaRue was present at a 1972 meeting with Mitchell and Nixon aide Jeb Stuart Magruder at Nixon's vacation home in Key Biscayne , Fla . , where the plan to break into the Watergate complex in Washington allegedly was hatched .
LaRue said he advised against the burglarization of the building , which housed Democratic Party headquarters .
After his political career ended in scandal , LaRue returned to his home state of Mississippi to work in his family's oil company and with its real estate holdings .
LaRue discounted rumors that he was Deep Throat , saying the mysterious source for Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein on the Watergate story was not one person , but probably a combination of several people .
