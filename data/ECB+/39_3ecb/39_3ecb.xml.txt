Tennant has now been voted one of the most popular Doctors of all time and is handing his sonic screwdriver over to actor Matt Smith .
Of course , there has been a media frenzy , with practically every national tabloid screaming `` Who ? ? '' .
But the casting of Smith is a stroke of genius : he will not bring any `` star personality '' with him that perhaps a `` name '' would have , but he seems utterly committed , and I have to say he does have an other-worldly look to him .
