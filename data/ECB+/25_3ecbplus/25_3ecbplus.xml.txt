Saints place RB Pierre Thomas on injured reserve
One day after placing leading rusher Chris Ivory on injured reserve , the Saints have lost another RB for the season .
Coach Sean Payton announced Wednesday that Pierre Thomas was placed on IR .
Thomas suffered through an injury - plagued 2010 season , missing 10 of the Saints' 16 games with a troublesome left ankle sprain .
He returned to play in Weeks 14 - 16 , but missed New Orleans' season - finale after tweaking the injury .
Ivory made the most of his opportunities with Thomas and Reggie Bush ( broken tibia ) missing time with injuries .
The undrafted rookie averaged 5 . 2 yards a carry and finished with a team - high 716 yards rushing and five touchdowns .
The Saints re - signed RB DeShawn Wynn to take Ivory's place on the roster on Tuesday .
After putting Thomas on IR Wednesday , New Orleans replaced him by signing RB Joique Bell off the Eagles' practice squad .
Thomas joins a growing tally of shelved Saints RBs .
Ladell Betts went on IR in early December and the team lost Lynell Hamilton and P . J . Hill to season - ending injuries during the preseason .
Bush , veteran Julius Jones and Wynn are expected to carry the load as the Saints try to defend their title .
New Orleans begins its postseason Saturday at 4 : 30 p . m . ET with a wild - card round game in Seattle against the NFC West champion Seahawks .
