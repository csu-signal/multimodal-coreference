Wladimir Klitschko defended his WBO and IBF heavyweight titles in Germany today with a lopsided victory over the American Hasim Rahman , winning by TKO in the seventh round .
Klitschko dominated the early rounds , repeatedly landing hard jabs that Rahman just could n't answer .
In the third round Klitschko so thoroughly dominated that I scored it a 10-8 round even though Rahman never went down .
Klitschko eventually wore Rahman down enough to knock him to the canvas in the sixth round -- a round in which Rahman did n't land a clean punch at all .
Early in the seventh , Klitschko staggered Rahman , and the ref mercifully stopped it .
Klitschko and his brother Vitali are generally recognized as the two best heavyweights in the world , and although they 'll never fight each other , I hope they 'll start fighting better opposition than Rahman , who is well past his prime and appeared to be out of shape .
Mismatches like this one do n't do much to advance heavyweight boxing .
Klitschko improved his record to 52-3 and is now on a 10-fight winning streak .
Rahman fell to 45-7-2 and is now 10-5-2 with one no contest since knocking out Lennox Lewis in 2001 .
