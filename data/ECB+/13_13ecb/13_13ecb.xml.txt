The Wasilla Bible Church in Wasilla , Alaska was apparently attacked by an arsonist last night .
The fire , which broke out when several people were inside the church , did an estimated $ 1 million damage .
Authorities described the fire as `` suspicious and as potential arson . ''
The Bible Church 's head minister said , `` Someone intentionally did it , but we do n't know who and why . ''
He declined to say whether the church has received threats .
Governor Palin stopped by the church this morning and `` told an assistant pastor that she apologizes if the incident is in any way connected to the undeserved negative attention the church has received since she became a vice presidential candidate . ''
Given the insane hatred that Democrats directed toward Palin during the recent campaign , it would be easy to jump to the conclusion that the arson is the work of a liberal Democrat .
But we do n't know that for sure .
There are many possible motives , and arsonists do n't necessarily need what would normally be regarded as a motive .
It would be a good thing for the country if this particular crime does not turn out to be politically motivated .
