A Georgia judge handed Brian Nichols today four consecutive life sentences without the possibility for parole sentence today .
He was convicted of killing four people , including a judge in a court room shooting in 2005 .
A court officer was also killed outside the court and an off-duty officer the next day .
`` I will not bring dishonor to the decision to spare my life , '' Nichols , 37 , told the court .
`` I 'm giving you the maximum -- every day I could give you , '' Superior Court Judge James Bodiford said , in the same court where the killing occurred .
`` If I could give you more , I would . ''
Nichols was on trial for rape when on March 11 , 2005 he overpowered a guard and seized her weapon , killing in the court room Judge Rowland Barnes and the court reporter Julie Ann Brandau ;
he also was convicted on killing Sgt. Hoyt Teasley outside the courthouse and killing the next day off-duty U.S. Customs Agent David Wilhelm .
Nichols said : `` I know that the things that I 've done caused a lot of pain , and I am sorry . ''
Jurors deadlocked with nine in favor and three against the death sentence .
Ironically Nichols had offered to plead guilty in return for life behind bars but prosecutors had refused .
