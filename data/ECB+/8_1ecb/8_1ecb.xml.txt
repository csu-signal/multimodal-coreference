A bomb explosion at a bank killed a police officer and a state bomb disposal technician , and state police did not have any suspects , officials said Saturday .
`` That person is dangerous and needs to be found as soon as possible , '' said Lt. Gregg Hastings of the Oregon State Police .
The explosion occurred Friday afternoon at a West Coast Bank branch in Woodburn , about 30 miles south of Portland .
The police went to check on a telephoned bomb threat received by a Wells Fargo bank branch in the center of town and found a suspicious device that turned out to be harmless .
But the police said the investigation led them to the nearby West Coast office where the bomb was found .
The police would not discuss a possible motive for the bombing .
Lieutenant Hastings said he did not know of any grudges against the West Coast Bank , a statement echoed by its president and chief executive , Robert Sznewajs .
`` We 're not aware of anything , '' Mr. Sznewajs said .
Police Capt. Tom Tennant and Senior Trooper William Hakim , both 51 , died at the scene. Captain Tennant was a 28-year veteran of the Woodburn Police Department , and Trooper Hakim , a bomb technician , had been with the force for 11 years .
Woodburn 's police chief , Scott Russell , 46 , was injured .
Chief Russell , who has been with the Police Department for two decades , was in critical condition but stable at a Portland hospital .
State police said the inside of the bank was extensively damaged , and a female employee was treated at a hospital and released. Another bank employee was uninjured .
Lieutenant Hastings declined to describe the bomb in detail but indicated it was powerful .
A bank employee found the bomb in bushes outside , and it exploded after officers took it inside .
Lieutenant Hastings said he did not know why the officers took the bomb inside .
Federal authorities said Saturday that they were offering a $ 35,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction in the case .
