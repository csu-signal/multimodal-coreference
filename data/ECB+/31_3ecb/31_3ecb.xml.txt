Tyler Hansbrough scored 20 Thursday night to break North Carolina 's career scoring record and help the No. 1 Tar Heels remain unbeaten with a 91-73 victory over Evansville in Chapel Hill , N.C .
The reigning national player of the year finished 7-for-14 from the field and had nine rebounds for North Carolina ( 10-0 ) , which shook off a slow start and stretched the lead to double figures shortly after Hansbrough passed Phil Ford for the record midway through the first half .
Ford , now an assistant coach to Larry Brown with the NBA 's Charlotte Bobcats , finished his career in 1978 with 2,290 points .
