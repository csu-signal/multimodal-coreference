Williams , 32 , was arrested around 1 : 30 a . m . Feb . 1 on state Route 94 on suspicion of drunken driving .
Results from a blood - alcohol test administered when Williams was arrested were released Wednesday , showing a level of 0 . 07 percent - - just under the state legal limit of 0 . 08 percent , California Highway Patrol Officer Brian Pennings told The San Diego Union - Tribune .
