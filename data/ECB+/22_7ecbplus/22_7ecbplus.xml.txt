Woman Convicted of Double Murder In 2010 Kraft Foods Rampage In NE Philadelphia
September 10 , 2012 4 : 15 PM
A Philadelphia judge today found a former Kraft Foods company employee guilty of murder in a workplace rampage exactly two years ago in Northeast Philadelphia that left two women dead and a third employee wounded .
Witnesses say defendant Yvonne Hiller had long complained of abuse by fellow employees , claimed they were poisoning her by spraying her with chemicals including deer urine .
But authorities say the allegations were investigated by police and OSHA and were determined to be unfounded .
Then , on September 10 , 2010 , according to a surviving victim , Hiller went berserk again , cursing and making accusations and threats .
She was suspended on the spot and escorted from the building .
But , the witness says , she returned minutes later with a gun , opening fire on several employees in a break room , killing Latonya Brown and Tanya Wilson , and wounding Bryant Dalton .
Dalton says the bullet went through his neck and lodged in his shoulder , and is still there .
In the one - day , non - jury trial , Common Pleas Court judge Benjamin Lerner found Hiller guilty of two counts of first - degree murder and one count of attempted murder .
The automatic sentence in life in prison , although formal sentencing will take place at a later date .
