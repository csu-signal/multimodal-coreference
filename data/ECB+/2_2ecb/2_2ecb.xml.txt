It 's a tough job hosting the Academy Awards .
It 's supposed to be entertaining , but it 's also a night for the stars to revel in the glory of an Oscar win .
And the host has to be edgy and funny , without going over the line and insulting the honorees .
But when it works , as it did in 1992 when tough-guy actor Jack Palance did push-ups in front of comedian and host Billy Crystal , only to become the butt of Crystal 's jokes for the rest of the night , it makes for memorable moments .
On Friday , the organization behind the Academy Awards named Australian actor Hugh Jackman as the host of February 's annual show .
Jackman is the first non-comedian to single-handedly host the show in recent years .
The last time an Australian hosted the show was in 1987 , when to `` Crocodile Dundee '' star Paul Hogan shared the stage with actress Goldie Hawn and comedian Chevy Chase .
Coming off starring in `` Australia , '' which has had only limited box office success since its Nov. 26 opening with a total box office take of $ 43 million , Jackman will rely on song and dance instead of just jokes to entertain a worldwide audience on Oscar night .
He has done well hosting the Tony Awards , the Broadway version of the Oscars , but the Oscars ' audience is used to comedians on the show .
On a night where hype and pomp rule , the comedian 's role is often to keep the show grounded by injecting a jester 's dose of realism .
Jackman 's naming as host prompted a `` love it or hate it '' reaction here on our news floor in Los Angeles .
There did n't seem to be much in between , so we thought we 'd leave it to readers to weigh in with their own thoughts .
