Saints RB Pierre Thomas placed on injured reserve
The New Orleans Saints placed Pierre Thomas on injured reserve Wednesday because of an ankle injury .
Thomas missed nine games this season because of the injury , including the regular - season finale .
He is the second running back in two days to be placed on injured reserve .
Chris Ivory was placed on the list Tuesday .
That means former Seahawk Julius Jones and Reggie Bush will likely get most of the workload .
"We've just got to get the next guy up and make sure we're prepared , " New Orleans coach Sean Payton said in a conference call with Seattle - area reporters .
So is the next guy in line Jones ?
"I wouldn't assume he's taking the bulk of the carries , " Payton said .
"I was in Dallas when we drafted him so I'm familiar with the player .
He's filled in in a real good role for us .
I think he's smart .
He's someone that typically does the right thing , and the other thing is , he's healthy .
So from a repetition standpoint , he's gotten X number of carries and plays , but not too many .
So what's most important now on a short week for both teams is being rested both physically and mentally and prepared to play in this game , and I know he will be . "
