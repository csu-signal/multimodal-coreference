Undersea cables damage disrupts Internet services in Egypt
Internet services in Egypt have been disrupted due to damage of undersea cables in the Mediterranean Sea , the Egyptian National Telecommunication Regulatory Authority said Friday .
Up to 80 percent of Internet services and call centers in Egypt have been cut after the submarine cables were damaged south of Italy on Friday for unknown reason , said the Egyptian MENA news agency .
The Egyptian side has contacted the international companies running the cables to give a repair report , MENA quoted an official source as saying , adding Internet services in Egypt is expected to improve in 12 hours .
Earlier in the day , Egyptian Minister of Communications and Information Technology Tareq Kamel ordered to set up an operation room to follow up the repair works , which are carried out by an international marine cable repair company .
Egypt is also trying to switch its Internet service to a backup route via southeast Asia and satellite .
Egypt is constructing another undersea cable , namely TE-North , to connect the northern Egyptian port city of Alexandria and the southeastern French city of Marseille , said MENA .
It is the second time in 2008 that Egypt witnessed a large scale Internet services cut due to submarine cable damage .
In January , Internet services and international calls were also partly cut in Egypt , along with a number of countries in the Middle East and south Asia .
