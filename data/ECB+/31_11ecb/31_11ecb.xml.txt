Tyler Hansbrough broke Phil Ford 's 30-year hold on the all-time North Carolina scoring record last night with an otherwise routine turnaround shot that never looks pretty with 7:41 left in the 1st half .
Hansbrough 's 20 points and the Heels putting away Evansville 91-73 were afterthoughts , the entire night was dedicated to the historic event inside the Dean Smith Center .
The game was stopped following the basket to recognize the achievement , and the celebration continued after the game when Hansbrough addressed the crowd .
UNC officials bottled his tears so that scientists can study their possible healing ability .
