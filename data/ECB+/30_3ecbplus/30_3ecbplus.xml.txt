An undersea telecommunications cable cut on Tuesday partially blocked internet and mobile services in Alexandria and some other governorates .
The cable cut happened around the same time that a different cable , owned by Telecom Egypt , was cut that also affected services , Egyptian authorities said .
Mahmoud al - Goweiny , a member of the National Telecommunications Regulatory Authority's board of directors , told Al - Masry Al - Youm that this particular undersea cable has frequently malfunctioned since late 2007 .
Ahmed Osama , deputy executive director of Telecom Egypt , said the cable passes through Egypt from Europe and reaches Asia .
Osama said the cut's effect in Egypt was limited , and there haven't been clear reports about a cause .
"Some internet users suffered problems with internet and mobile services , Osama noted .
Osama attributed these problems to the Telecom Egypt cable cut , which affected Etisalat Egypt and LINKdotNET , two of Egypt's largest internet services providers .
No further details were reported about the effects of the cuts .
