Apple unveils new MacBook Pro with Ivy Bridge at WWDC
posted Jun 11th , 2012 at 1 : 23 PM
Apple is certainly making WWDC a hardware conference this year - - it just unveiled a refresh of the existing MacBook Pro running Intel's newer Ivy Bridge processors on the San Francisco gathering's opening day .
The 13 - and 15 - inch portables run up to 2 . 7GHz quad Core i7s ( turbo up to 3 . 7GHz ) , carry up to 8GB of RAM and have GeForce GT 650M - based graphics 60 percent faster than the previous generation .
Like the new MacBook Air , they tout USB 3 . 0 ports .
If you're more comfortable with Apple's conventional MacBook Pro design than the new variety , Apple will ask $1 , 099 for the base 13 - inch version and $1 , 799 for a 15 - inch version , with an upgraded 15 - inch model going for $2 , 199 .
All of them are shipping today - - we're not seeing any mention of an updated 17 - inch version , so it may have been cast aside .
