Tuesday , July 2nd , 2013
A powerful earthquake in Indonesia's Aceh province flattened buildings and sparked landslides Tuesday , killing at least five people and injuring dozens in a region devastated by the quake - triggered tsunami of 2004 .
The 6 . 1 - magnitude quake struck inland at a depth of just 10 kilometers in the mountainous Bener Meriah district in the heart of Aceh , the US Geological Survey said .
It destroyed houses in the district , some 320 kilometers from the provincial capital Banda Aceh , and triggered several landslides .
Police and troops were deployed to lead rescue efforts , as pictures showed the walls of houses reduced to rubble and roads badly damaged and blocked by landslips .
Five people had so far been confirmed dead in the quake , Fauzi , an official from the local disaster agency , told AFP late Tuesday .
In Suka Makmur village a landslide engulfed a coffee plantation , killing one man , said the official who uses one name .
"A man was working at a coffee plantation with his wife when a landslide caused by the quake struck , " he said .
"His body was found under a pile of earth soon afterwards , " he said , adding that his wife and another woman were missing at the site .
Four other people died in hospitals in the district from injuries sustained in the quake , he said .
One of the fatalities was a child who died when a wall collapsed , Ema Suryani , a doctor at a health clinic in Lampahan city in the district , told AFP .
"We have received around 50 people with injuries sustained when the walls of their houses collapsed , " added the doctor .
"There are around 30 people seriously injured , some with head injuries .
The rest have only light injuries like minor cuts and grazes . "
Injured people had been transported from several affected villages in two trucks , she said .
Around 40 houses were damaged by the quake , including some which were flattened , said disaster agency official Fauzi .
Most of the damaged houses were in the Wih Pesam area of the district , he added .
People ran outside in panic in Banda Aceh as the quake shook houses , and in Medan city to the south of the province on Sumatra island .
"The quake was felt strongly for around 15 seconds , from Bener Meriah to Banda Aceh .
People panicked and rushed out of their homes , " national disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said .
Aceh , on the northern tip of Sumatra , is regularly hit by quakes .
In 2004 a massive tremor sparked a tsunami that killed 170 , 000 people in the province and tens of thousands more in countries around the Indian Ocean .
In April last year an 8 . 6 - magnitude quake struck 431 kilometres off Banda Aceh , prompting an Indian Ocean - wide tsunami alert .
Five people died and seven were injured in Aceh in the quake and following aftershocks .
In September 2009 a major earthquake near Padang city on Sumatra killed more than 1 , 000 people .
Indonesia sits on the Pacific "Ring of Fire" where tectonic plates collide , causing frequent seismic and volcanic activity .
