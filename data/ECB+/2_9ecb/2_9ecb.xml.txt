And the legitimization of funnybooks continues , as today the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has announced that Wolverine himself will be hosting the 81st Academy Awards , proving once again that he 's the best there is at what he does - even hosting a major awards ceremony !
Okay , so it 's a bit of a stretch there , but regardless , today it was announced that one of our own , Hugh Jackman , will be the host of the ceremony , televised live on Sunday , February 22 , 2009 , from the Kodak Theatre at Hollywood and Highland Center on ABC .
While it 's certainly clear that Jackman has come into his own as one of Hollywood 's top leading men of both stage and screen , what us geeks know him best as is Wolverine from both the `` X-Men '' series of films as well as next year 's `` X-Men Origins : Wolverine . ''
In a statement released today by the Academy , producers had this to say about their choice of Jackman as the telecast 's host , `` Hugh Jackman is a consummate entertainer and an internationally renowned movie star .
He also has style , elegance and a sense of occasion .
Hugh is the ideal choice to host a celebration of the year 's movies - and to have fun doing it . ''
