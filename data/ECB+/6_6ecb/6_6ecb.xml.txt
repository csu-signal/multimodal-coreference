Rumored to be the front runner earlier in the week , Entertainment Weekly has now confirmed that Chris Weitz will direct the sequel to Twilight , New Moon , replacing Catherine Hardwicke .
Hardwicke reportedly clashed with Summit Entertainment during Twilight 's production and EW says Weitz landed the New Moon gig because he has a solid relationship with the studio , he 's considered easy to work with and has experience with special effects .
In New Moon , the second novel in Stephenie Meyer 's young-adult series , Bella ( Kristen Stewart ) recovers from the vampire attack that almost claimed her life .
She looks to celebrate her birthday with Edward ( Robert Pattinson ) and his family , however , a minor accident during the festivities results in Bella 's blood being shed , a sight that proves too intense for the Cullens .
They decide to leave the town of Forks , Washington for Bella and Edward 's sake. Melissa Rosenberg is writing the screenplay .
Weitz co-directed American Pie , Down to Earth and About a Boy with his brother Paul .
Last year he helmed The Golden Compass , based on the Philip Pullman novel , which did n't impress North American audiences but was a hit overseas .
New Moon is tentatively scheduled to open November 20 , 2009 .
