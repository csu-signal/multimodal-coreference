Indonesia 's West Papua province was hit by a magnitude 6.1 earthquake today , the latest powerful tremor to shake the region where five people were killed and hundreds injured at the weekend when buildings were destroyed .
The quake struck off the coast at 7:48 a.m. local time , 75 kilometers ( 50 miles ) west of the region 's main city of Manokwari , the U.S. Geological Survey said in an alert .
There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties and no tsunami alert was issued .
A United Nations assessment team was dispatched to the province after two quakes , measuring 7.6 and 7.4 , struck west of Manokwari Jan. 4 .
At least five people were killed , 250 others injured and more than 800 homes destroyed by those temblors , according to the UN .
About 14,000 people fled their homes at the weekend after a local tsunami warning was issued , the UN said on its Web site .
The Indonesian government has transported relief supplies , including food , medicine , tarpaulins , generators and water purification equipment to the affected areas .
Two three-story hotels in Manokwari , a city of 160,000 people , collapsed in the Jan. 4 quakes and buildings were also damaged in the town of Sorong , according to the World Health Organization .
Manokwari 's Rendai Airport was also temporarily closed on security and safety concerns , the WHO said .
Indonesia lies in a zone where the Indo-Australian , Eurasian , Philippine and Pacific plates meet and occasionally shift , causing earthquakes and sometimes generating tsunamis .
There have been hundreds of earthquakes in Indonesia since a 9.1 temblor in 2004 caused a tsunami that swept across the Indian Ocean , devastating coastal communities and leaving more than 220,000 people dead in Indonesia , Sri Lanka , India , Thailand and other countries .
