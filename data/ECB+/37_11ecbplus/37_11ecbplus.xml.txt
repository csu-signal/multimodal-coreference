6 . 1 - magnitude quake strikes Indonesia's Aceh : USGS
A powerful 6 . 1 - magnitude earthquake struck the Indonesian province of Aceh with no tsunami warning issued
AFP , Tuesday 2 Jul 2013
A strong 6 . 1 - magnitude earthquake struck the northwestern Indonesian province of Aceh on Tuesday , the US Geological Survey said , sending people running into the streets in panic .
There were no immediate reports of damage after the quake struck inland at a depth of just 10 kilometres ( 6 . 2 miles ) , 55 kilometres south of Bireun and 72 kilometres southeast of Reuleuet , said the USGS .
People ran out of buildings in panic in the provincial capital Banda Aceh as the quake shook houses for around one minute , an AFP journalist at the scene said .
But the USGS estimated there was a low likelihood of casualties or damage .
A massive quake struck off Aceh in 2004 , sparking a tsunami that killed 170 , 000 people in the province on Sumatra and tens of thousands more in countries around the Indian Ocean .
Indonesia sits on the Pacific "Ring of Fire" where continental plates collide , causing frequent seismic and volcanic activity .
