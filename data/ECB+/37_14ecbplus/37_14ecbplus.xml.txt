Tuesday , July 2 , 2013
A strong earthquake struck Indonesia's Aceh province on Tuesday , killing at least one person and leaving two others missing .
Many houses were damaged and dozens of villagers were injured .
The magnitude - 6 . 1 quake struck at a depth of just 10 kilometers ( six miles ) and its epicenter was located 55 kilometers ( 34 miles ) west of the town of Bireun on the western tip of Sumatra island , the US Geological Survey said .
The worst - hit area was the district of Bener Meriah , where the quake caused a landslide that killed a man and left his wife and a young boy missing , said Fauzi , an official of the local disaster agency .
"Dozens of people were injured and are being treated at three hospitals , " said Fauzi , who like many Indonesians uses a single name .
He said at least 22 houses were badly damaged in the district .
At least five people were reportedly injured and 10 houses were damaged in Takengon , the capital of Central Aceh district , said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho of the National Disaster Mitigation Agency .
"I see many houses were damaged and their roofs fell onto some people , " said Bensu Elianita , a 22 - year - old resident in Bukit Sama village in Central Aceh district .
"Many people were injured , but it is difficult to evacuate them due to traffic jams . "
She said people in the village ran out from their houses in panic and screamed for help .
At least two homes were totally flattened , she said , adding that the quake also caused a blackout in the village .
The quake also caused panic among officials attending a meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation in Medan , the capital of neighboring North Sumatra province .
The officials were escorted from the second - floor meeting room by security officers .
Indonesia is prone to seismic upheaval due to its location on the Pacific Ring of Fire , an arc of volcanoes and fault lines encircling the Pacific Ocean .
In 2004 , a huge earthquake off Aceh triggered a tsunami that killed 230 , 000 people across Asia .
