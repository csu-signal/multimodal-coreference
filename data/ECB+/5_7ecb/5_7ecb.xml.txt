The Eastern Conference standings have claimed another coach , with Philadelphia 76ers head man Maurice Cheeks joining the ever-growing list of coaches who are no longer employed .
The 2008-09 season was supposed to be a good one for the Sixers , who claimed the summer 's top free agent prize in Elton Brand and then assured that their big three would be together long-term by re-signing Anre Iguodala .
Unfortunately , it has n't played out that way to date .
Currently sitting at 9-14 on the season , the only thing stopping Philly from being complete buried in the standings is that so many Eastern Conference teams are struggling , as well .
Despite their poor start and their current three-game losing streak - likely to end tonight as the team takes on the Wizards - the Sixers are still just two games in the loss column behind the eighth seed in the East .
Cheeks marks the third Eastern Conference head coach to get fired this season , following in the footsteps of the Toronto Raptors ' Sam Mitchell and the Washington Wizards ' Eddie Jordan .
Cheeks will be succeeded by Assistant GM Tony DiLeo .
