4 . 6 - magnitude earthquake shakes Lake County
Thursday , March 14 , 2013
Lake County's Cobb Mountain community was shaken awake early Thursday morning by a magnitude 4 . 6 earthquake that startled even folks accustomed to seismic activity because of its size .
While shakers around magnitude 2 and 3 are common to the area , Thursday's 2 : 09 a . m . jolt lasted longer and proved stronger than usual , residents said .
"It lasted a really long time .
You could tell" it was larger , said Hardester's Market clerk Alicia Mullin .
"It was pretty significant , " said Bonnie Evans at the Texaco station in town , where cigarettes , canned soups and a couple of bottles in the walk - in fridge had been knocked to the ground .
The U . S . Geological Survey reported that the quake was centered about 3 miles southwest of Cobb , in a seismically active area near The Geysers geothermal steamfields .
Residents of Sonoma County felt it , too , including some as far south as Santa Rosa .
