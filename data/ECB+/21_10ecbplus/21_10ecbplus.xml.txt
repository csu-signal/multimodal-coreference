New York woman killed in hit - and - run crash
On behalf of Howard R . Sanders , Esq . posted in Pedestrian Accidents on Wednesday , September 18 , 2013 .
According to investigators , a woman was killed by a hit - and - run driver in Queens on the night of Sept . 13 .
At approximately 7 p . m . , the woman was walking near the intersection of 117th Street and 97th Avenue in Richmond Hill .
She was walking among some parked cars when she was hit by a grey Toyota Camry that had been traveling north on 117th Street .
The driver fled the accident scene but was apprehended by police officers .
The driver was charged with DWI , leaving the scene of an accident resulting in death , criminally negligent homicide and vehicular manslaughter .
A hit - and - run accident may be considered an example of extreme recklessness or carelessness on the part of a driver .
A personal injury attorney might review a hit - and - run accident case and suggest seeking punitive damages .
In some instances , it is possible to collect damages that exceed compensation for lost wages , medical expenses and funeral costs .
The intention is to punish reckless and negligent drivers and also to send a message to other drivers .
If the family wishes to seek only compensation for accident - related expenses , the attorney may negotiate for a settlement outside of court .
On the other hand , if the family decides to seek punitive damages , the attorney might request a jury trial in civil court .
If the at - fault driver was charged or convicted in criminal court , it may help support the claim of recklessness .
The attorney may use police reports , photos and evidence to build a convincing argument on behalf of the family .
If the judge and jury are persuaded by the argument and evidence presented , they may find in favor of the plaintiffs and award punitive damages .
