Paris : Jewellery Stolen In Casty Shop Raid
11 : 39am UK , Monday 09 September 2013
Four men smash their car into a jewellery store before fleeing in a different vehicle in the latest high - profile heist in France .
Jewellery and watches worth £1 . 7m have been stolen during a heist in an upmarket central Paris shop .
Four men drove a 4x4 through the front window of the store on Rue de Castiglione , before making off with the jewellery and watches .
They then set fire to the vehicle before fleeing in another car .
Forensic policemen are examining the Casty store in the central first district of the capital , home to numerous jewellery shops .
The heist near Place Vendome is the latest to hit France after a spate of high - profile robberies in the southern resort of Cannes .
At the end of July , an armed man carried out a robbery at a diamond exhibition at the Carlton Hotel in Cannes , making off with jewellery worth £88m in one of the world's biggest ever heists .
And last month thieves made off with £35 , 000 of jewellery after cracking two safes at the luxury Grand Hotel du Cap in Saint - Jean - Cap - Ferrat , near Nice .
In May , thieves stole £910 , 000 worth of jewellery from an employee of Swiss firm Chopard that was due to be loaned to film stars during the Cannes Film Festival and a second theft saw a diamond necklace worth £1 . 2m stolen .
Paris has also been the scene of high - profile robberies .
In December 2008 , three men emptied almost the entire stock of gems from the Harry Winston jewellery store .
Police said they had recovered 80% of the haul in 2009 .
