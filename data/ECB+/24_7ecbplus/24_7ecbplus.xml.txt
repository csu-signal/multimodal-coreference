9 September 2013 11 : 55
Four men rammed their car into an up - market jewellery store in central Paris today , smashing the shop window and making off with a €2 million ( R26 million ) booty , a police source said .
The heist near the upscale Place Vendome is the latest to hit France after a spate of high - profile robberies in the southern resort of Cannes .
The police source , who wished to remain anonymous , said the men drove a large 4×4 car into the store in the early hours of the morning , and grabbed jewellery and luxury watches worth an estimated €2 million .
They then set fire to the vehicle and escaped in another car .
Forensic policemen are currently going through the site of the robbery at the Casty store on Rue de Castiglione in the central first district of Paris , which is home to numerous jewellery shops .
At the end of July , an armed man carried out a brazen robbery in broad daylight at a diamond exhibition at the Carlton hotel in Cannes , making off with jewellery worth €103 million in one of the world ’ s biggest heists .
Paris has also been the scene of high - profile robberies .
In December 2008 , three men emptied almost all of the stock of gems from the Harry Winston jewellery store .
In 2009 , police said they had recovered 80% of the haul .
