on Mar 8 2013 , 11 : 55p
The Missouri Valley Conference , aka "Arch Madness" , certainly lived up to its nickname on Friday .
Eight teams competed in the quarterfinal round , and we've already had one memorable last - second game .
Now there's just four teams left fighting for the automatic bid on Saturday .
Let's recap Friday's action .
No . 1 Creighton Bluejays 65 , No . 9 Drake Bulldogs 53
Doug McDermott put on a show as usual , scoring 23 points and becoming the school's all - time leader in points scored .
He had help from his teammates , as well , as Gregory Echenique finished with a double - double ( 11 points , 11 rebounds ) .
The Bulldgos never let this game turn into a blowout , but they never came close enough to make Creighton sweat , either .
The Bluejays will play Indiana State on Saturday .
