No militants were inside a United Nations-run school attacked by Israeli forces in Gaza , leaving 40 people dead , the UN says .
Christopher Gunness from the UN Relief and Works Agency said an initial investigation left him 99.9 per cent sure there were no militants at the school .
About 1000 people were sheltering in the school after having been hounded from their homes by warfare , he said .
Mr Gunness slammed the Israeli attack on the school .
`` Of course it 's appalling , '' he told ABC Television from Jerusalem .
`` This fighting has to stop . ''
`` Enough people , among them women and children , have died . ''
Mr Gunness said civilian deaths were an inevitable consequence of attacking a crowded place like Gaza .
`` Imagine a situation where someone says we 're going to plan a massive air bombardment , but it 'll be pinprick and surgical , on downtown Sydney , '' he said .
