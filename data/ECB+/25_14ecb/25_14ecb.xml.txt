Bush placed on injured reserve
The Saints placed running back Reggie Bush on injured reserve ending his season .
The decision was made after Bush met with Dr. James Andrews this past week .
Bush injured his left knee on Oct. 19 and had arthroscopic surgery to fix a torn meniscus and missed four games .
He was bothered by the knee last week against the Bears and did n't play in the second half .
Pierre Thomas will get most of the carries and is an excellent play against the Lions this week .
