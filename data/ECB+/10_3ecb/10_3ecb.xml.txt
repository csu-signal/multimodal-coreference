The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim offered free-agent first baseman Mark Teixeira an eight-year contract at the Winter Meetings in Las Vegas .
Owner Arte Moreno met with Scott Boras , Teixeira 's agent , and presented him with the offer , which is believed to be worth at least $ 160 million and possibly as much as $ 180 million over the life of the contract .
`` It 's something they can consider - or should consider , '' Angels general manager Tony Reagins told MLB.com on Friday .
`` They have the right . ''
Other teams in the battle for Teixeira are the Baltimore Orioles ( seven years , $ 140-150 million ) , Washington Nationals ( eight years , $ 160 million ) and Boston Red Sox .
The New York Yankees also have expressed interest .
Teixeira , 28 , was acquired by the Angels in a July 29 deal with the Atlanta Braves last season and hit 13 home runs and 43 RBIs in 54 games .
Overall , he finished the season with a .308 average , 33 homers and 121 RBI .
It marked the fifth straight 30-homer , 100-RBI season for Teixeira .
He batted .467 with seven hits and four walks in the American League Division Series as the Angels fell to the Red Sox in four games .
