The Bush administration is reducing protections for endangered animals and plants .
Just six weeks before Democratic President-elect Barack Obama takes office , the current Republican administration is changing endangered species regulations .
Some mandatory , independent reviews that government scientists have performed for 35 years are being eliminated .
The scientists ' advice from such reviews can delay or block dams , highways and other projects .
The new rules will take effect in about 30 days .
The rules also prohibit federal agencies from evaluating the effect on endangered species and the places they live from a project 's contribution to increased global warming .
Obama has promised to reverse the new rules .
Congress also could overturn them .
