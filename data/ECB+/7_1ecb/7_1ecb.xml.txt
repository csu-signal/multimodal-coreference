Wladimir Klitschko ( 52-3 , 46 KOs ) blasted a sluggish Hasim Rahman ( 45-7-2 , 36 KOs ) in Mannheim , Germany on Saturday night to retain the IBF , WBO and IBO world heavyweight titles .
After flooring Rahman in the sixth round with a left-right combo Klitschko wasted little time wrapping it up in the seventh with a big left-right-left series that led to the referee stepping in and stopping the fight at the 2:15 mark .
Rahman , a former heavyweight champion who shocked the world when he floored Lennox Lewis in 2001 for the title , showed absolutely no signs of life against Kiltschko on Saturday .
The final numbers showed Klitschko landing 178 of 369 punches thrown while Rahman connected on just 30 of 207 punches thrown .
