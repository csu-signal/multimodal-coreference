It 's official : Chris Weitz is taking over the director 's chair for the `` Twilight '' sequel `` New Moon . ''
`` Twilight `` author Stephenie Meyer confirmed the news on her official website Saturday morning in a post designed to calm the rising anguish among fans who loved the first film adaptation .
After bidding a fond farewell to `` Twilight '' director Catherine Hardwicke , Meyer went on to praise Weitz and to let fans know that `` torches and pitchforks are not going to be necessary . ''
On the one hand , Weitz has shown his skill at adapting popular modern novels for the screen -- `` About a Boy , '' from the Nick Hornby novel , won Weitz and co-scripters Paul Weitz and Peter Hedges an Oscar nomination for best adapted screenplay .
On the other hand , Weitz also directed last year 's `` The Golden Compass , '' which was an expensive mess that failed to capture the fan base of the book .
