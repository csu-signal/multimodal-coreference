A strong earthquake rattled Indonesia 's West Papua province Wednesday just days after a powerful quake levelled buildings and killed one person , the United States Geological Survey said .
The 6.1-magnitude quake was the latest in a series of dozens of powerful tremors to have hit the region since 7.6 and 7.5 magnitude quakes that struck off the provincial capital Manokwari on Sunday .
Wednesday 's shallow quake hit at 7 : 48 am ( 2248 GMT Tuesday ) just off the coast , some 75 kilometres ( 50 miles ) west of Manokwari .
Officials had been put on alert to deal with more devastation to the area -- where thousands of people have been living in tents since Sunday 's quakes -- but no damage or injuries had been reported , provincial disaster chief Rahimin Kacong was quoted by AFP as saying .
The quake was accompanied by smaller quakes with a magnitude over 5.0 off Kupang in East Nusa Tenggara Province and Ternate in North Maluku province , Indonesia 's seismological agency said .
Around 14,000 people flooded into camps on high ground in the aftermath of Sunday 's quakes fearing deadly waves after authorities issued and then withdrew a tsunami alert .
Many refugees have returned home but some remain too fearful to go back Kacong said .
`` We already told people to return to their houses following the meteorological office report saying that the frequency of aftershocks has reduced , '' he said .
Hundreds of government and private buildings have been damaged by the Sunday quakes , as well as seven bridges , two of which have collapsed .
The tremors have re-awakened bitter memories of similar deadly quakes that hit Manokwari in 2002 , as well as the Asian tsunami that killed 168,000 people in Indonesia 's Aceh province and Nias island in 2004 .
