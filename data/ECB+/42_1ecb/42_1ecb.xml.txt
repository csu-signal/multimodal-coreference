T-Mobile is bolstering its smartphone portfolio by picking up Research In Motion ( NSDQ : RIMM ) 's next-generation BlackBerry Curve .
The Curve 8900 is the latest refresh of the popular Curve line , and it 's the thinnest full-QWERTY BlackBerry ever .
The smartphone also takes some design cues from the BlackBerry Bold , and it has a titanium-colored finish with chrome highlights .
The handset should be able to multitask smoothly , as it 's powered by a 512-MHz processor. Like other BlackBerry handsets , the Curve 8900 should have strong messaging capabilities .
Users can get personal and corporate push e-mail from up to 10 accounts , and there 's built-in instant messaging .
Some users may be disappointed that the new Curve can not use T-Mobile 's growing 3G network , but the EDGE connection is more than capable of sending and receiving e-mails on the go .
There 's also integrated Wi-Fi , and the Curve 8900 can be used for unlimited Wi-Fi calling with T-Mobile 's HotSpot Calling service .
`` With rich multimedia capabilities , exceptional mobile e-mail and messaging features , enhanced Web browsing , a premium phone , and easy access to social networking communities , including Facebook , Flickr , and MySpace.com , the BlackBerry Curve 8900 helps you make the most of a busy lifestyle that spans well beyond normal business hours , '' said Mark Guibert , VP of RIM 's corporate marketing , in a statement .
The handset will come with built-in GPS that can be used for location-based searches and navigation .
The Bluetooth version 2.0 can be used to pair headsets , as well as for stereo Bluetooth headphones .
It packs a 3.2-megapixel camera that also can be used to record video .
RIM has been making strides with its multimedia capabilities , and the Curve 8900 is no exception .
The handset will be able to play multiple types of audio , and video should look crisp with the display 's 480-by-360 resolution .
Users will not have to worry about running out of storage space , as the smartphone comes with a microSD slot that 's expandable up to 16 GB .
T-Mobile said the new Curve will be available in February , but the company did not give a price .
