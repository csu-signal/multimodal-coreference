Posted : Thursday , July 29 , 2004
Fred LaRue , a high - ranking Nixon administration official who served a prison term for his role in Watergate and was among those rumored to be Deep Throat , has died .
He was 75 .
His body was discovered Tuesday by a maid who entered his hotel room in Biloxi , Coroner Gary Hargrove said .
The coroner said he thinks LaRue died Saturday of natural causes .
LaRue was known as the "bagman" who delivered payoffs to keep participants in the Watergate break - in quiet and served 412 months in federal prison for conspiracy to obstruct justice .
LaRue served as special assistant to John Mitchell , the former attorney general who later headed President Nixon's Committee to Re - elect the President .
LaRue discounted rumors that he was Deep Throat , saying the source for Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein on the Watergate story was probably a combination of people .
