Warren Jeffs Trial : Defends 'Spiritual' Marriage , Polygamy
July 29 , 2011|10 : 57 pm
Warren Jeffs , leader of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints , who has been silent since his trial began last Thursday , spoke for the first time with the jury present Friday .
Jeffs is charged with two counts of sexual assault for raping two under - aged girls and fathering a child with one of the girls .
Objecting to the testimony from an FBI agent about documents seized from his church's compound in 2008 , Jeffs delivered a 55 - minute speech arguing that the raid on the church was illegal and that charges brought upon him and other members of the FLDS were unwarranted .
"You are now touching that which is sacred .
Thus on these grounds we call upon this court to render justice before sacred trust is trampled upon , " Jeffs said during his objection .
During the raid of the Yearning for Zion Ranch , executed after a tip that turned out to be a hoax , police witnessed several underage girls who were heavily pregnant .
This led to the arrest of Jeffs as well as 11 other men of the FLSD .
Thus far , seven men have been tried and convicted of sexual assault and bigamy , among other crimes , and have received sentences of between six and 75 years .
Jeffs himself may receive up to 119 - years in prison if convicted .
In his testimony on Friday , Jeffs said there was no crime , explaining that he and both girls had a "spiritual" marriage bond .
He went on to say that the FLDS must "follow the law set out for it by God . "
"If we do not live these laws we are damned here and hereafter .
We believe in a marriage system of eternity called celestial marriage , wherein celestial means heavenly authorized , not to be intervened by government intervention , " Jeffs said .
Jeffs ended his speech by saying , "Amen . "
Jeffs remained completely silent during the first four days of the trial , during which he dismissed his defense team in order to serve as his own defense , and refused to give an opening statement after the judge declined his request for more time to prepare .
"Mr . Jeffs , the court is not going to recess these proceeding to let you go to law school , " said U . S . District Judge Barbara Walther .
In the meanwhile , special prosecutor for the Texas attorney general's office , Eric Nichols , delivered his opening statement , detailing that he will submit as evidence an audio recording of Jeffs having sex with a 12 - year - old as well as a DNA report confirming Jeffs as the father of a 15 - year - old FLSD member's child .
Jeffs remained silent throughout the prosecution's opening statement but interjected repeatedly during Nichol's response to his speech .
Judge Walther recessed the court and directed that Jeffs speak with his counsel , who remains available in case they are needed , about proper court decorum .
Director of criminal clinics for the Texas Tech School of Law , Patrick Metze , commented on the case , saying Jeffs won't be able to continue the trial without lawyers .
"At some point , the judge will have had enough , so it's not going to be a pleasnt experience and she's not just going to let him prophesize , " Metze told the San Angelo Standard Times .
