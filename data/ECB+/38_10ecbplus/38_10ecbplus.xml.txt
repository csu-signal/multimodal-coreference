4 - Plus Earthquake Recorded Near Healdsburg
At a Richter magnitude of 4 . 6 , this one should have awakened sleepers
March 14 , 2013 at 12 : 41 PM
An earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 4 . 6 was recorded in the North Bay this morning , according to the U . S . Geological Survey .
The quake occurred at 2 : 09 a . m . about 14 miles north - northeast of Healdsburg and had a depth of 1 . 2 miles .
The region is close to The Geysers geothermal plant , which has frequent earthquakes of much lower magnitude .
According to Earthquaketrack . com , it is the largest earthquake in the area for the past month .
Did any Patch readers feel the earthquake , or perhaps wake up shortly after 2 a . m . because of it ?
