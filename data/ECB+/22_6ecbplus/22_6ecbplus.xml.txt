Accused Philadelphia Kraft Foods Killer Held For Trial
December 7 , 2010 11 : 18 PM
The woman who allegedly shot and killed two co - workers in September at the Kraft Foods plant in Northeast Philadelphia will face trial on multiple counts of murder and attempted murder .
At a hearing on Tuesday , assistant district attorney Gail Fairman described 43 - year - old Yvonne Hiller as a “ methodical killer ” who waved a gun within a foot of a security guard ’ s face to regain access to the plant less than ten minutes after she had been escorted out .
“ She returned like a grim reaper , ” says ADA Fairman , “ and she only shot the ones that she held responsible for her suspension . ”
Fairman says that when Hiller found a group of co - workers in a break room , she allowed one person to leave unharmed .
“ At one point , there was a co - worker holding onto Latoya Brown , ” says Fairman , “ and the defendant ordered that worker away , and then she shot Brown . ”
Hiller had repeated run - ins with co - workers , whom she accused of spraying her with a deer scent , among other things ( see related story ) .
Two women were pronounced dead at the scene , and a male co - worker was wounded .
A detective testified during the preliminary hearing about Hiller ’ s statement to police , claiming people had been spraying her for years .
The defense would not comment on strategy plans for the trial .
