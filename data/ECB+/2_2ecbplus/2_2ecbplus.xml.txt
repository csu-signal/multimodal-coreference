Ellen DeGeneres to host 2014 Oscars

Ellen DeGeneres was so nice as an Oscars host the first time , the Academy has asked her to do it twice .
"It's official : I'm hosting the #Oscars ! " DeGeneres tweeted Friday .
"I'd like to thank @TheAcademy , my wife Portia and , oh dear , there goes the orchestra . "
