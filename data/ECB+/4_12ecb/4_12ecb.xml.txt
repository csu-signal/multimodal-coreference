Yesterday in Los Angeles , pin-up icon Bettie Page succumbed to complications from a heart attack suffered almost three weeks ago .
Few women in modern history have incited such lust and reverence in men and women alike .
To the rockabilly culture , she embodied the ideal woman - voluptuous and healthy , with that leveling sneer .
She seemed to dare you to not stare at her .
Her hairstyle launched a thousand girls to slice off their bangs and get out the black dye .
Literally tens of thousands of women are walking around today as perfect Bettie clones of all shapes and sizes .
With her nude photoshoots , the bondage angle and her defiance in the face of censorship , she was a precursor to the '70s feminist movement - '50s punk rock in heels and garters .
Page has been the inspiration for dozens of songs all across the musical landscape , but it was the rockabilly guys that took to her the most ; not to mention female-fronted bands like the Horrorpops or even pop 's Katy Perry .
Even Amy Winehouse 's look in the beginning was a derivative of Page .
