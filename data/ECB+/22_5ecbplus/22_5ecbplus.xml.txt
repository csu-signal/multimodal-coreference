Yvonne Hiller , Accused in Kraft Shooting , Is A Muslim
September 10 , 2010
Yvonne Hiller , who has been arrested and charged with the Kraft shooting of her co - workers at Kraft Foods yesterday evening has been revealed to be a Muslim who was very spiritual .
At this point it is unclear if the shooting had anything to do with the approaching anniversary of the 9 - 11 attacks on America by radical members of the Muslim faith .
However it does seem odd that Hiller had a . 357 Magnum in her car , which is what she used .
That â€™ s a pretty heavy - duty gun .
NBC Philadelphia has interviewed another co - worker of hers , Kenneth Dorsey , and he said he had talked with her about her Muslim faith and even wished her happy Ramadan .
