Christopher Simpson shoots pregnant girlfriend dead cause he didn't want another child to support .
An Oklahoma jury has found 27 year old Christopher Simpson guilty of first degree murder of his then pregnant 20 year old girlfriend Ka'loni Flynn and their 12 week unborn child .
The murder came after Flynn resisted Simpson's demands to have an abortion and his reluctance with having to 'deal with another child to support . '
In finding Christopher Simpson guilty the jury recommended that he be sent to maximum life in prison without parole .
His sentencing is scheduled for November 8 .
Prosecutors allege that Simpson , who has at least one child from a past relationship , shot Flynn twice in the head because he did not want another baby to support .
A DNA expert testified that the 27 - year - old fathered the 12 - week - old fetus .
The murder is said to have taken place on April 9 at 3 am in Flynn's car which was parked at the time .
It wasn't until in late June that authorities arrested Christopher Simpson believing that he was the chief instigator of her death .
Told the deceased's father , Herbert Flynn Jr : 'I'm glad it's over .
I'm glad we got the verdict we got .
She deserved it . '
During closing arguments , Crawford County Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Jacob Howell showed a photograph of Flynn's body in the driver's seat of car , with bullet wounds to her temple and forehead .
Prosecutors went on to acknowledge that the case against Simpson was complicated and mostly circumstantial .
Told Howell : 'I hope we showed you this was investigated thoroughly , and that every possible suspect was investigated and excluded except one . '
Simpson's attorney , Warren Gotcher , argued that no witnesses could place Simpson at the crime scene and that his client was innocent .
Prosecutor Anthony Evans countered by telling that Simpson was trying to deflect blame because 'the defendant has the spotlight on him , and it's hot , and he needs to get it off him .
So what does he do ?
He pushes it over here .
Desperate men do desperate things . '
According to a police affidavit , the couple had been dating for about three months when the 20 - year - old found out she was pregnant .
Purportedly Simpson became angry and expressed that he did not want to be a father again .
Pushed to get an abortion , Flynn declined telling Christopher Simpson that she did not believe in abortion .
Of course the better question may have been if either one of the couple believed in using contraceptives and if not why ?
Herbert Flynn Jr told 5News after Simpson's arrest that on the night of his daughter's murder , she was planning to meet with her boyfriend to ask for help in applying for government assistance .
Around the time of the shooting , Simpson was late on child support payments for his 7 - year - old daughter , and according to a local sheriff , he had made statements to his friends that he did not want another child .
After Flynn's death , a witness told police that Simpson bragged to him that his girlfriend's killing will never be solved because it was 'too clean' and 'the perfect murder . '
The 20 - year - old woman , who aspired to be a nurse , allegedly told a friend a short time before the slaying that Simpson had threatened to end the pregnancy for her if she refused to abort the baby .
