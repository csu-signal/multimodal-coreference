T-Mobile USA , Inc. and Research In Motion today announced that T-Mobile will offer the BlackBerry Curve 8900 to customers in February .
The announcement confirms rumors from December .
The 8900 is the thinnest full-QWERTY BlackBerry smartphone yet .
Like its predecessor , the 8320 , the 8900 is fully-featured with connectivity options including a built-in GPS and WiFi , something that users of T-Mobile 's Unlimited HotSpot Calling service should be excited about .
Of course , the Curve 8900 has an impressive list of features of its own .
It has been upgraded with a 3.2-megapixel camera with image stabilization and video compatibility .
It sports a 512MHz processor and at 480 x 360 , its the highest resolution screen available on a BlackBerry .
It supports microSD cards up to 16GB ( Like the new SanDisk memory cards announced today ) .
Last , the Curve 's Quad-band radio , with support for international roaming , should please the jet-setter .
Look for it next month at T-Mobile retail stores , authorized dealers , and online .
