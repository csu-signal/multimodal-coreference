The Indian navy has captured 23 Somalian pirates .
The pirates were about to board a vessel in the Gulf of Aden when they were apprehended .
Last month , India 's navy drew criticism after sinking a Thai fishing trawler that had been commandeered hours earlier by pirates , but the navy says it fired in self-defence .
Somali pirates have become increasingly brazen , and recently seized a Saudi supertanker loaded with e75m worth of crude oil .
