Saints place RB Bush on injured reserve
The injury-plagued season of New Orleans Saints running back Reggie Bush is over .
The Saints placed Bush on the injured reserve list Wednesday with a sprained left knee , meaning he will miss the team 's final two games against Detroit and Carolina .
However , given his limited effectiveness last week , the Saints decided to shut him down for the remainder of the season .
The former Southern California star finished his third season in New Orleans with just 404 yards and two touchdowns on 106 carries .
Bush suffered a left knee injury against Carolina on October 19 and missed the next four games following arthroscopic surgery .
He returned to action against Tampa Bay on October 30 and scored a touchdown the following week against Atlanta .
Bush appeared to be on the mend , but he sprained the knee in last Thursday 's 27-24 overtime loss at Chicago and was limited to only 30 yards on six carries .
On Saturday , New Orleans coach Sean Payton indicated that Bush would not return to the lineup until further undergoing a further evaluation .
However , given his limited effectiveness last week , the Saints decided to shut him down for the remainder of the season .
Bush 's absence leaves the Saints furthered shorthanded in the backfield as they are now down to Pierre Thomas and Mike Bell , who has had only six carries this season after signing with New Orleans in Week 12 .
To take Bush 's roster spot , the Saints signed cornerback Michael Lehan , who had been with the Miami Dolphins .
