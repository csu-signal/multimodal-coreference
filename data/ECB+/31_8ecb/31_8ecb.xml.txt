Hansbrough breaks 30-year-old UNC scoring mark
Forward Tyler Hansbrough broke North Carolina 's all-time scoring record in Thursday 's game against Evansville .
Phil Ford 's school mark of 2,290 points set in 1978 held strong amongst a plethora of talented Tar Heels over the years , but Hansbrough , who came back for his senior season after being crowned the National Player of the Year , moved into the top spot with a tough leaner in the lane with two Purple Aces defenders hanging on him with 7:42 left in the first half .
The game was stopped and Ford was on hand to congratulate Hansbrough at half-court .
The Missouri native suffered through a shin injury earlier in the season that forced him to miss four games .
In the five games he played before Thursday 's action , Hansbrough averaged a team-high 22.8 points to go with 7.2 rebounds .
In 113 career games prior to Thursday , the forward has logged 20.2 points and 8.6 rebounds in just under 31 minutes an outing , while doing a lot of damage at the free throw line with nearly nine attempts per game .
Hansbrough , who has an outside shot at edging Duke great J.J. Redick for the all-time ACC scoring record ( 2,769 points ) , has succeeded in just about every statistical category , though he is still searching for the elusive fifth national title for the program , which moved to 10-0 after its 91-73 drubbing of Evansville .
Hansbrough finished the game with 20 points and nine rebounds .
