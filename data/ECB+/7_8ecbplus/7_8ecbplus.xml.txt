Wladimir Klitschko retained his WBA , IBF and WBO heavyweight title belts by stopping American challenger Tony Thompson in the sixth round .
The Ukrainian world champion extended his unbeaten run to eight years by overcoming 40 - year - old Thompson in Berne , Switzerland on Saturday .
Thompson never recovered from a big right hand from Klitschko near the end of the fifth round .
And the contest was over when Thompson hit the canvas again in the sixth .
It was 36 - year - old Klitschko's 58th victory , 51 by KO , for only three defeats - and his 16th in a row .
Wladimir and his older brother Vitali have dominated the heavyweight division for so many years that they are now revisiting fighters from the past .
Thompson last met Wladimir Klitschko in 2008 , when the American's challenge was ended in the 11th round .
