RCMP MAKE ARRESTS IN BC POLYGAMOUS COMMUNITY
POLICE HAVE MOVED IN AND ARRESTED AT LEAST TWO MEN FROM THE RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY OF BOUNTIFUL IN THE BC INTERIOR .
BC ATTORNEY GENERAL WALLY OPAL ISSUED A STATEMENT TODAY SAYING THAT TWO MEN , WINSTON BLACKMORE AND JAMES OLER , HAD BEEN ARRESTED `` ON CHARGES OF POLYGAMY PURSUANT TO THE CRIMINAL CODE . ''
OPAL SAYS THE ARRESTS ARE THE PRODUCT OF A SEVEN-MONTH CHARGE ASSESSMENT REVIEW BY SPECIAL PROSECUTOR TERRENCE ROBERTSON .
OPAL POINTS OUT THAT THIS PROSECUTION IS INDEPENDENT OF BOTH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE BRANCH AND THE BC GOVERNMENT .
CRITICS HAVE SAID IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO PURSUE POLYGAMY CHARGES AGAINST MEMBERS OF BOUNTIFUL FOR FEAR THAT CRIMINAL PROSECUTION COULD VIOLATE THEIR RELIGIOUS FREEDOMS .
