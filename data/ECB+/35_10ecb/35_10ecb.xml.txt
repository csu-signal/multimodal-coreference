Chargers ' Jackson arrested on suspicion of DUI
But after being arrested for suspicion DUI earlier this week , he has bigger worries than his role in the Chargers ' offense .
10News in San Diego is reporting that Jackson was arrested by the California Highway Patrol early Tuesday morning after failing sobriety tests .
CHP Officer Brad Baehr said Jackson was on probation for a previous DUI arrest .
The Chargers will not discipline Jackson at this time , but it 's almost a guarantee that the NFL will step in and suspend him for several games at the start of this season .
However , unless you hear otherwise , Jackson will be playing in this week 's divisional playoff at Pittsburgh .
Those in postseason leagues ( like our SalCap game or our 3-for-All game ) should avoid Jackson , but not just because of his recent troubles with the law .
He was held without a catch for the second time all year last week , and this week he faces Pittsburgh 's top-ranked pass defense ( 156.9 yards allowed per game ) .
In San Diego 's first meeting with the Steelers this season , Jackson was held to just two catches for 25 yards .
Jackson 's recent run-in with the law effectively puts an end to his keeper value for next season .
