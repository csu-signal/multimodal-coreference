Warren Jeffs Found Guilty on Sexual Assault Charges
on August 04 2011 5 : 46 PM
A San Antonio jury has found polygamist leader Warren Jeffs guilty on both sexual assault charges on Thursday .
The 55 - year older leader of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints was charged with sexual assault of a child after taking a 12 - year old girl and a 15 - year girl as "spiritual wives . "
He could be sentenced to up to 119 years in prison .
The jury's decision puts an end to a controversial case that saw Jeffs represent himself against the charges .
Jeffs largely avoided defending himself during the case , only offering a "I am at peace , " phrase as his closing statement .
The jury made its decision on the same day that the prosecution played a tape recording of what it alleged was Jeffs sexually assaulting the 11 - year old girl .
