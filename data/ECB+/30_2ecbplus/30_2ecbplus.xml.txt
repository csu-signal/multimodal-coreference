Undersea internet cables severed near Egyptian coast line
Have you experienced any internet connection or mobile phone problems yesterday ! ?
It seems that another incident of an undersea telecommunications cable being severed on Tuesday has resulted in partially blocking internet and mobile services in Alexandria and some other governorates .
In a statement to Al - Masry Al - Youm news paper , Mahmoud Al - Goweiny , a member of the National Telecommunications Regulatory Authority's board of directors said that the cable cut happened around the same time that a different cable , owned by Telecom Egypt , was also cut , affecting services in Egypt .
He also iterated that this particular undersea cable has frequently malfunctioned since late 2007 .
This cable is most likely to be the SEA - ME - WE 4 that passes through Egypt coming from Europe and then reaches Asia .
Despite the after effects of this cable cut seems to be limited , however these incidents have been occurring more than once in a relatively short period of time .
Severing a main internet pipe - line could leave a country's communication and economy crippled for at least 72 to 120 hours causing a lot of problems !
It should be time to re - think protecting these valuable communication life lines !
Etisalat Egypt and LinkdotNet are one of Egypt's largest internet service providers , and among the most affected by the cable cut .
No further details were reported by Authorities about the effects of the cable cuts .
