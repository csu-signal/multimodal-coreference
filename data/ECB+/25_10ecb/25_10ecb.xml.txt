New Orleans Saints RB Reggie Bush 's season over
The Associated Press reports New Orleans Saints running back Reggie Bush ( knee ) will miss the rest of the season .
Bush underwent an MRI earlier this week , and head coach Sean Payton decided the team would place Bush on Injured Reserve .
It has been a disappointing campaign for Bush ;
the 2006 second-overall pick played in just 10 games this year , rushing for 404 yards and two touchdowns while catching 52 passes for 440 yards and four scores .
However , he missed time because of arthroscopic knee surgery earlier this year and apparently a knee sprain will halt his season .
In Bush 's absence this year , running back Pierre Thomas has established himself as a legitimate No. 1 back .
He has 189 rushing yards and two touchdowns in his last two games .
He has also caught eight passes for 66 yards and two touchdowns .
Of his 11 touchdowns this year , eight have come since the start of Week 11 .
He has 548 rushing yards , 28 receptions and 258 receiving yards this season .
Running back Deuce McAllister could see a few more touches with Bush out , yet even when Bush was out earlier this year , McAllister only once received more than eight utilizations in a game ; the team used him 22 times in Week 8. McAllister has just 317 rushing yards on the season and only 54 since the team 's Week 9 bye .
However , he does have three of his four touchdowns in that stretch .
Fullback Mike Karney has received five utilizations in the last two weeks , though most are on short-yardage situations .
Fantasy owners carrying Bush have almost certainly missed out on Thomas ;
if for some reason he is available , pick him up immediately .
McAllister is a last-ditch flex option as the Saints face the Detroit Lions in Week 16 , but playing him is a risk given Thomas ' versatility .
Karney is not a viable fantasy back .
