Polygamist prophet Warren Jeffs charged againJuly 23 , 2008 . 4 : 49 pm
Seven indictments , nine charges and six leaders of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints now face trial in Texas .
Among them is FLDS prophet Warren Jeffs , who has already been convicted in Utah on two counts of being an accomplice to the rape of a 14 - year - old girl and is now awaiting trial on similar charges in Arizona .
The FLDS also has followers living in Bountiful , B . C . Bountiful has been the object of scrutiny by the RCMP and the B . C . attorney general since 2004 .
A special prosecutor , Terry Robertson , was appointed in June to determine whether charges should be laid .
The Texas grand jury heard evidence collected during the April raid on the Eldorado compound that resulted in more than 400 women and children being taken into protective custody .
They were later allowed to return to the compound after a Texas appeal court ruled that the child protection officials had overstepped their legal boundaries .
The grand jury also heard testimony from at least four FLDS women including prophet Warren Jeffs's 16 - year - old daughter who her father placed into a religious marriage to an older man when she was just 15 .
The Texas charge against Jeffs is a first - degree felony count of sexually assaulting an under - aged girl .
The other men - none of whom have yet been named - face charges related to sexual assault of under - aged girls and bigamy .
Jeffs will not be tried in Texas until he goes to court in Arizona .
Matt Smith , the county attorney in Mohave County , Az . said in a press release Wednesday that he had heard about the charges , but "the indictments in Texas do not affect the Arizona case at all . "
The Americans have taken a very different approach to the FLDS .
In Utah , Arizona and Texas , the main thrust of the investigation has been the sexual abuse of under - aged girls .
In British Columbia , Attorney - General Wally Oppal has focused his attention mainly on the Criminal Code offence of polygamy .
