SEVENTEEN hours after the attack on one of his schools killed 40 Palestinians seeking shelter from Israel 's war on Hamas , the United Nations ' director of operations in Gaza , John Ging , was certain of at least one thing `` We have established beyond any doubt that the school was not being used by any militants , '' Mr Ging told The Age last night .
`` They were innocent people . ''
Speaking by phone from the UN 's Relief and Works Agency in Gaza , Mr Ging struggled to contain his anger at the attack that has also left more 50 people with serious injuries , 10 of whom remain critical .
Israel has demanded that Hamas be prevented from rearming as a main condition for a ceasefire .
When the Israeli attack came on the Prep C girls school in the Jabaliya camp at 3.45pm on Tuesday , Mr Ging said about 350 Palestinians were inside , using the school as a shelter .
`` The reason they were in the school is because the Israelis had told them to go there , '' he said .
`` They were doing exactly as they had been told . ''
To ensure there was no confusion about the school 's location , Mr Ging said the United Nations gave specific GPS co-ordinates to Israeli Defence Forces commanders .
But after receiving reports that mortar shells had been fired at Israeli units from within the school grounds , the commanders decided to strike back .
`` They shot back to save their own lives , '' said Israeli Defence Forces spokesman Ilan Tal .
Three tanks shells exploded just outside the school grounds , causing pandemonium inside .
`` As you can imagine , this was a very distressing attack , '' Mr Ging said .
`` It has killed 40 people , and some of those who were injured may yet die .
`` Now we need to know how this happened .
A full , transparent and independent inquiry has to be held to determine exactly how this occurred . ''
The Israeli Defence Forces maintained that mortars had been fired from the school .
In a statement released by spokesman Captain Benjamin Rutland , it said it had incontrovertible evidence to support its version of events .
`` This is not the first time that Hamas has fired mortars and rockets from schools , in such a way deliberately using civilians as human shields in their acts of terror against Israel , '' the statement said .
Brigadier-General Avi Benayahu said the Israeli Defence Forces had established that Hamas terror operatives were among the dead at the school , and had proof of a mortar battery cell that had been firing in the area .
`` Hamas operatives Imad Abu Askhar and Hassan Abu Askhar were among terrorists that were identified to be killed , '' he said .
The attack on the school has caused widespread shock across Israel , intensifying pressure on Prime Minister Ehud Olmert to reach a ceasefire .
After 13 days of bombardment of Gaza from the air , land and sea , which has claimed more than 660 lives , the past few days of fighting have been among the bloodiest in the history of the Israel-Palestinian conflict .
Five Israeli soldiers lost their lives on Wednesday , four from friendly fire , bringing to 10 the number of Israelis who have been killed .
Just before midnight on Tuesday , three Gazans were killed when Israeli forces attacked another UN school in Gaza City .
Earlier that day , a shell hit a house in the Beach refugee camp , killing at least seven members of one family .
Shelling of houses in the Bureij refugee camp left at least five dead and 16 injured .
