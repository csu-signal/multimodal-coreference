As if the Middle East and South Asia do n't have enough problems with war , terrorism and poverty , now communications in many of the nations in those regions have been disrupted .
The cause - three international underwater cables in the Mediterranean Sea that were damaged Friday .
Millions of people trying to make phone calls or log on to the Internet wo n't be doing so for a while .
A similar problem happened nearly a year ago , but this one has the potential to be worse .
The damage this time broke all three of the cables connecting Europe with Asia via the Middle East .
Many carriers in the Middle East and South Asia will have to route their European traffic around the globe , instead of via a more direct route .
No word yet on an official cause of the damage .
Previous reasons for cable breaks include oil drilling and wayward anchors .
