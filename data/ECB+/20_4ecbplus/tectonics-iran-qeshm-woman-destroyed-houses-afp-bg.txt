An Iranian woman walks past destroyed houses in Qeshm Island, southern Iran, 28 November 2005. Several thousand Iranians spent the night in tents without electricity after their villages were hit by a powerful earthquake on an island off the southern coast that left 10 people dead. Rescue workers were today ferrying the injured to hospitals and providing tents, blankets and food to survivors of the quake which struck the Gulf island of Qeshm on Sunday with a force of about 6.0 on the Richter scale.
