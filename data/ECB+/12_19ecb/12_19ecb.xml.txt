Taking the lead in the fight against piracy , the Indian Navy on Saturday arrested 23 Somali pirates .
An Indian warship , INS Mysore deployed in the Gulf of Aden attacked two boats of pirates after receiving signals from a ship that the pirates were trying to hijack .
The Indian warship was patrolling in the Somali waters when it rushed to rescue MV Gibe , a merchant vessel flying the Ethiopian flag .
The pirates on two speed boats had surrounded the merchant vessel , when INS Mysore warship intervened and warded off the attack , Navy spokesperson said here .
The pirates had fired at the merchant vessel with their small arms , when it sent out a rescue call and the Indian warship , which was sailing nearby moved its Marine Commandos on an helicopter to help the distressed cargo vessel , he said .
The attack took place about 150 nautical miles off Aden and INS Mysore was about 13 nautical miles away from the merchant vessel when it picked up the SOS call .
The Navy flew its Marine Commandos on helicopters to the scene of the pirate attack and rescued the ship. MV Gibe was later escorted to safety , he added .
The Indian commandos also recovered 12 AK 47 guns , three rifles , two grenades along with other ammunition .
Out of 23 arrested pirates , 12 are reportedly from Somalia and 11 from Yemen .
The Indian warship , the INS Mysore , was dispatched to the Gulf of Aden after a spike in piracy and hijackings off the coast of Somalia , which is caught up in an Islamic insurgency and has had no functioning government since 1991 .
