The United Nations on Wednesday denied Israel Defense Forces claims that there were Palestinian militants in the Gaza school bombed by Israel on Tuesday .
Christopher Gunness of the UN Relief and Works Agency ( UNRWA ) said the organization is 99.9 percent certain there were no militants or military activity in its school .
That does not necessarily contradict Israel 's claim that the militants were operating close by , Gunness said .
Gunness put the death toll of the shelling at 40 , and added that the agency wants an impartial investigation of witnesses , Israeli military photographs or any other evidence .
The IDF on Tuesday released video footage from 2007 showing Palestinian militants firing from the school compound and carrying a rocket launcher with them as they flee the scene .
