Maurice Cheeks has been fired as head coach of the Philadelphia 76ers following the club 's disappointing 9-14 start to the season .
The Sixers have dropped their last three and are just 2-8 in their last ten after high expectations following an offseason that brought Elton Brand to Philly .
Cheeks had signed an extension to his contract in September that was guaranteed through next year but the club felt they needed to make a change to reverse their fortunes .
Assistant general manager Tony DiLeo will replace Cheeks as the interim head coach and he is expected to hold the position through the year .
Philadelphia fans had expected the 76ers to be a contender this year following a playoff appearance one year ago and then adding Brand .
