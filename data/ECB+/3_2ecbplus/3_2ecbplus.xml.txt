Convicted Child Molestor Arcade Joseph Comeaux Jr . On The Lam in Texas
Nov . 30 , 2009
A convicted child molester who was supposedly confined to a wheelchair overpowered two prison guards today , handcuffed them , stole their weapons and walked off wearing one of their uniforms .
Arcade Joseph Comeaux Jr . , 49 , is serving a life sentence for several charges – including indecency with a child – and was en route from the Estelle Unit in Huntsville , Texas , to the Stiles Unit in Beaumont , Texas , when he escaped just after 9 a . m .
Lyons said that Comeaux used a wheelchair in prison – he "claimed it was necessary for his mobility" – and added , "Since he fled on foot , that's obviously in question . "
Described as a 6 - feet tall and weighing approximately 200 pounds , Lyons warned that Comeaux knows the area where he escaped well and could have family nearby .
He initially was imprisoned on February 1979 on three 10 - year sentences for rape of a child , aggravated rape of a child , and burglary of a building with the intent to commit theft .
His supervision was revoked and he returned to prison in May 1984 with a new charge of indecency with a child , given a new 20 year sentence .
Between 1991 and 1998 , Comeaux was in and out of prison on parole violations until he finally returned to prison in June 1999 to serve a life sentence for aggravated sexual assault .
In 1999 , Comeaux stabbed his wife during a visit , using his wheelchair to pin her against a wall while he stabbed her .
His wife survived , but another inmate who tried to break up the attack also suffered stab wounds , and Comeaux was convicted of additional assault charges and received two additional life sentences .
