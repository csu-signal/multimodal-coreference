THOUSANDS of frightened residents flooded makeshift refugee camps in Indonesia 's West Papua province today after two powerful earthquakes flattened buildings and killed at least one person .
Residents camped out in yards and streets outside their homes , and there were some 14,000 refugees across the province , many of whom had fled to higher ground , officials said .
`` For the time being there are 14,000 refugees , '' Governor Abraham Atururi said , adding that 17 camps had been set up for the displaced in the provincial capital Manokwari .
As aid started to arrive , hundreds of aftershocks continued to rattle the coastal city which was hit by the 7.6 and 7.5 magnitude quakes early on Sunday , cutting power and prompting a brief tsunami warning .
Atururi said a 10-year-old girl was killed and at least 40 people were injured in the earthquakes , which rekindled bitter memories of similar deadly quakes that hit the town in 2002 .
Hundreds of government and private buildings were damaged in the quake , as well as seven bridges , two of which collapsed , he said .
Four central government ministers arrived by plane bringing 1.5 billion rupiah ( $ A195,900 ) in aid and to survey the damage , officials said .
Two tonnes of medicine was also flown in by the health ministry to Manokwari 's airport .
In Manokwari , many residents were camping outside their homes , but thousands from low-lying areas refused to leave camps on higher ground out of fear of a tsunami .
`` I 'm half-dead in my tent .
I want to go home but I 'm scared of a tsunami , '' said fisherman 's wife Mapahai , 35 , who fled with her husband and six children .
`` Two of my children are sick , I 'm also sick .
We have n't received any medicine yet , '' she said .
Indonesia 's Meteorology and Geophysics Agency ( BMG ) said Papua had been hit by 842 aftershocks over a period of 29 hours after the first quake , including 54 aftershocks stronger than five on the Richter scale .
`` It keeps on shaking , '' Papua BMG spokesman Mujahidin said .
Some 168,000 people were killed in Indonesia 's Aceh province and Nias island by the 2004 Asian tsunami , making it the worst hit country .
