Good sized quake at the California Geysers
I felt this one pretty good .
I'm located 25 miles south of the quake .
Slow easy rocking for about 6 seconds .
This one is pretty rare for the Geysers .
The Geysers is one of the most active areas of Northern California with small earthquakes hitting the area nearly every week .
A 4 . 4 quake is on the large size for The Geysers .
The UGSG Website says the largest quake ever to be recorded there was 4 . 5 .
