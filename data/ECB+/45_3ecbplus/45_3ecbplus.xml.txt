Oklahoma man pleads not guilty in deaths of Arkansas woman and her fetus
Published : January 3 , 2013
An Oklahoma man has pleaded not guilty to two first - degree murder charges for the deaths of an Arkansas woman and her fetus .
Trial is set for June 17 for 26 - year - old Christopher Kenyon Simpson of Fort Coffee , who is accused of fatally shooting Ka'Loni Marie Flynn of Fort Smith , Ark .
A local newspaper reports that Simpson has been held without bond at the LeFlore County Jail since his arrest on June 21 .
Flynn's body was found in a car near Spiro on April 9 .
Prosecutors allege Simpson shot Flynn after she told him she was pregnant .
Lawyers for Simpson don't want prosecutors to be able to use phone records that allegedly place Simpson in the area of the slaying on grounds that authorities obtained them without a warrant .
