Red Sox - Teixeira Rumor
December 15 , 2008 at 1 : 00pm CST
2 : 16pm : Take it with a grain of salt , but we have a report of a report that the Red Sox offered Mark Teixeira an eight - year , $200MM deal .
Earl Bloom of the Orange County Register heard Dan Patrick say it on his radio show .
It'd be best to treat the report with skepticism until it's confirmed by another source .
