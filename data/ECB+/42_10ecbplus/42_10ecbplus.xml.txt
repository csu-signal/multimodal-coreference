More details on the BlackBerry Q10's release in the US are starting to surface .
T - Mobile confirmed in an email that its business customers will have the opportunity to register for the device starting next week on April 29th , with availability and pricing details to follow "at a later date . "
General consumers will likely have to wait a little longer , if T - Mobile follows the same launch strategy that it did with the Z10 .
Of course , registration doesn't actually equate to pre - orders or actually purchasing the phone yet - - all we've heard from official channels is that it'll be coming towards the end of May - - but it's still a solid confirmation that QWERTY fans will at least be able to get their BB10 on in the very near future .
