Female Employee Yvonne Hiller Kills Two In Kraft Shooting
In a sad and surprising reversal of gender roles , a disgruntled woman opened fire at a Kraft factory in Philadelphia last night , killing two workers and wounding two others .
The shooting happened moments after the employee , Yvonne Hiller , was suspended from her job at Kraft , where she ’ d worked for 15 years , the Daily News reports .
After being escorted from the snack plant , she re - entered 10 minutes later with a handgun .
About 100 people were in the building when she began shooting .
Hiller was taken into custody after a standoff with the SWAT team .
A Kraft representative confirmed Hiller is now in police custody and that one of the wounded employees is in the hospital .
“ This is a sad time for the Kraft Foods family , ” a statement reads .
“ We are working closely with the authorities as they investigate this situation , and our facility is closed until further notice . ”
Unfortunately , the most surprising aspect of this incident is the shooter ’ s gender .
Women shooters are rare but may be on the rise .
In February , a woman opened fire at the University of Alabama , killing three and injuring several others .
Reportedly , she was a professor whose tenure had been denied .
Two years ago , a female college student committed a shooting at a Louisiana college .
