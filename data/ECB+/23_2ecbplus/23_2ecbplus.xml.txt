The Aoraki Mt Cook Alpine Rescue Team have recovered the body of the second climber to fall to his death at Mount Cook National Park over the weekend .
Inspector Dave Gaskin said the man fell around 2000ft ( 609 metres ) near the Mount Sefton Bivvy , above the Mueller Glacier .
''The fall was unsurvivable , '' Inspector Gaskin said .
There were four in the climbing party .
The friends of the deceased had to stay in position overnight until the weather was suitable to carry them out by rescue helicopter this morning .
The body was recovered in the afternoon , and taken to Mt Cook Village initially , then on to Timaru .
Inspector Gaskin confirmed the climbing party are foreigners , but would not specify any other details until the family of the deceased had been informed .
With two deaths at Mt Cook National Park this weekend , Inspector Gaskin said police and rescures were pushed to their limits
''Resources are tight , there's no doubt about that .
It's been very difficult but the guys have done a wonderful job . ''
He said the two deaths were not related to weather conditions .
''I can't speak for the first death , but in this case it looks like to be a lack of experience , '' Inspector Gaskin said .
Yesterday , a 36 - year - old Australian climber died after falling about 150 metres at Mt Cook .
The man , from Hampton East , fell in the Tasman Glacier area .
A Westpac Rescue Helicopter from Christchurch was called about 3pm to assist with search and rescue co - ordination at the Mt Cook base .
When it got there , the man had been transported to Mt Cook Village by a local helicopter service and pronounced dead by paramedics .
The man is thought to have fallen much earlier in the day .
