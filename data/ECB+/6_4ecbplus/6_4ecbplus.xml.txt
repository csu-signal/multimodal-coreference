Gary Ross back in talks to direct 'The Hunger Games' sequel 'Catching Fire'
April 9 , 2012
Despite reports last week that said Gary Ross would definitely not be returning to direct The Hunger Games sequel , Catching Fire , it seems he will be back at the negotiating table with Lionsgate this week .
The Hollywood Reporter says Ross is set to meet with Lionsgate officials on Monday to resume negotiations .
According to THR , two major sticking points are salary ( Ross apparently wants a raise ) and schedule , with The Hunger Games set to begin filming in August .
That's in part to accomodate Jennifer Lawrence's January start date for filming the X - Men : First Class sequel , a project that legally and contractually holds priority for the actress over Catching Fire .
Lionsgate is also under pressure to meet a previously announced November 2013 release date for Catching Fire .
The majority of fans were outspoken last week in their disappointment that Ross would not return for Catching Fire .
Some launched the "Gary Ross Is Boss" campaign to show support , a petition has been circulating Twitter , and it will be the top discussion subject on Monday night's episode of the HG Fireside Chat podcast .
What do you think about Ross returning ( or possibly not ) for Catching Fire ?
