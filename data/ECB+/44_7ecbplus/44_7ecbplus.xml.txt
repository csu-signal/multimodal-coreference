As part of its efforts to support energy - efficient computing , HP Monday announced it has signed an agreement to acquire facilities consulting firm EYP Mission Critical Facilities for an undisclosed sum .
HP says the deal , which will bring EYP MCF's 350 employees into a new division under HP Services , will help HP better address customers' needs for more efficient data centers .
The combined EYP and HP Services will let large , enterprise companies couple efficient facilities design with an optimized IT infrastructure .
Until recently , HP officials say , IT executives handled facilities and data - center design efforts separately .
With this acquisition , HP aims to bring the two more closely together and help build dynamic computing environments from the start .
"Data center transformation is a key focal point for the HP Services team , " says John McCain , senior vice president and general manager of HP Services .
"Power consumption is becoming one of the largest components in terms of the bill in data centers today . "
To combat the increase in energy spending , HP Labs has developed technology to conserve energy and delivers it via such products as HP Dynamic Smart Cooling and HP Thermal Zone Mapping .
The deal , according to EYP MCF representatives , will let consultants expand beyond facilities planning and offer expertise in large - scale data - center design .
"IT infrastructure is ready for a major paradigm shift in the way that mission - critical facilities are delivered to the marketplace , " says Steve Einhorn , chairman of EYP MCF .
"The data center and its facility are ready for a major change . "
HP says it expects the deal to close by its first fiscal 2008 quarter , which ends January 31 .
