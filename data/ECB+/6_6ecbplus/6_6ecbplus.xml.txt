Gary Ross has not departed "The Hunger Games . "
According to THR , Ross will resume negotiating with Lionsgate about returning for the "Games" sequel "Catching Fire" at some point on Monday .
It has been quite a three days for Ross .
On Friday , Indiewire's blog The Playlist exclusively reported that the director had stepped away from negotiations with Lionsgate , not because of any monetary strife , but because Ross wanted to do something different for his next film .
That was countered by Deadline . com's Nikki Finke and Mike Fleming , who wrote on Saturday that Ross hadn't stepped away , and that Lionsgate wanted him to return but for a reasonable price .
Ross was reportedly paid $3 million to write and direct "The Hunger Games . "
He'll also earn five percent of the backend grosses , a significant number since "Games" has already accumulated $459 million around the globe .
Per THR , the negotiations between the two parties are "delicate , " but a deal could get done soon .
After all , "Catching Fire" begins shooting in August with a script from Oscar winner Simon Beaufoy ( "Slumdog Millionaire" ) .
