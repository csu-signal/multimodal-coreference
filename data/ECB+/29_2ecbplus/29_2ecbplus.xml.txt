Colts clinch playoff berth with 20 - 13 win in K . C .
Posted on December 23 , 2012 , 4 : 42 PM EDT
The connection between quarterback Andrew Luck and wide receiver Reggie Wayne has been vital to the Colts ’ success this season .
It paid off one more time for the game - winning play in Week 16 .
Luck hit Wayne for a seven - yard touchdown with just over four minutes to play to break a 13 - 13 tie and put the Colts on the verge of a playoff berth .
The defense forced a three - and - out and rookie running back Vick Ballard ran for a first down to ice the game on the next Colts possession .
Give the Colts defense a lot of credit for this one .
Darius Butler ’ s interception return opened the scoring for them and they stuffed Chiefs quarterback Brady Quinn short on a fourth - and - inches play early in the fourth quarter .
The Colts took the ball and went 73 yards in 13 plays to set up Wayne ’ s game - winning score .
It had not been a great day for the Colts offense to that point , but they were able to come up with the drive they needed to punch their postseason ticket .
While you ’ re giving the defense credit , though , make sure that you ’ re careful to note all the chances the defense gave Kansas City as well .
Jamaal Charles had 226 yards on 22 carries , including an 86 - yard touchdown run , and Peyton Hillis ran for 101 yards .
Given the lack of threat posed by Quinn , it ’ s pretty damning that the Colts couldn ’ t keep Kansas City from running the ball .
That will likely be something for Chuck Pagano to worry about .
The head coach is expected to return to work on Monday after months away from the team battling leukemia .
Fixing the run defense before the playoffs will be hard , but it ’ s a good problem to have after drafting first overall last April .
