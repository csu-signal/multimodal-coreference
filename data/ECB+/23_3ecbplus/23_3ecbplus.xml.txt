English and Australian climbers fall to their deaths in New Zealand mountains
One Australian and one English climber have fallen to their deaths in New Zealand .
8 : 44AM BST 16 Sep 2013
Police Inspector Dave Gaskin said the two incidents on consecutive days in the Aoraki - Mt . Cook National Park were not related and were not due to bad weather .
He said they come as a reminder that climbers need to use extreme caution .
On Friday , 36 - year - old Duncan Rait died after slipping and falling about 200ft from a ridge near the Tasman Glacier .
The New Zealand - born Australian was planning to do some ski touring .
He â€™ d been dropped off by helicopter with a group and was walking to a hut when he fell , sliding down a steep slope and over a cliff .
Gaskin said that other climbers attempted to rescue Raite by taking him down the glacier , but that he died on the way down .
On Saturday , 32 - year - old Englishman Robert Buckley , originally from Essex , but living in Christchurch , fell about 2 , 000ft while climbing to a small hut on Mount Sefton with three companions .
Gaskin said Buckley was wearing crampons but was inexperienced .
Police said that Mr Buckley's group appeared to be "insufficiently" equipped and inexperienced for the climb they chose .
"They had hired some climbing equipment early that day and had managed to get within 80 meters of the bivvy , " police said .
"At this stage . . . one of the party has slipped on the ice and has fallen some 700 metres to his death . "
