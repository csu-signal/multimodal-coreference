Deep Throat suspect found dead in hotel
Thursday 29 July 2004 08 . 23 BST
One of the longest - running mysteries of American politics may soon be resolved after it was announced yesterday that the man many suspect of being Deep Throat in the Watergate scandal had died .
Fred LaRue , known as the "bagman" because he delivered payments to ensure the silence of participants in the Watergate break - in , was found dead in a hotel room in Biloxi , Mississippi .
He was 75 .
The two Washington Post reporters who broke the Watergate story , Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward , have maintained that they would only reveal the identity of Deep Throat once he was dead .
Although there have been several names advanced as Deep Throat , LaRue is one of the more likely candidates .
He was a special assistant to John Mitchell , the former attorney general who headed Creep , the Campaign to Re - elect the President , in 1972 .
LaRue was at a meeting at Nixon's Florida holiday home at which the scheme to break into the Democratic headquarters in the Watergate building in Washington was first mooted .
Although LaRue insisted he was not Deep Throat , and that the source was a combination of several people , Woodward and Bernstein have insisted Deep Throat was one person .
LaRue said last year that President Nixon had not been told of the plan to break into the building .
He cited his close relationship with Mr Mitchell to back up his claim that the president was ignorant of the plan .
LaRue served four and a half months in prison for his role in the Watergate conspiracy , after being charged with obstructing justice .
