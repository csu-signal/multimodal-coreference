AMA Celebrates Nomination of Regina Benjamin , MD , Surgeon General
For immediate release :
July 13 , 2009
The American Medical Association is delighted that Dr . Regina Benjamin , MD , has been nominated to serve as our nation's next U . S . Surgeon General .
Her many impressive accomplishments , including receiving a 2008 MacArthur Fellowship , commonly known as the "genius grant" , leave no doubt as to her qualifications .
"Dr . Benjamin's most important qualification for surgeon general is her deep commitment to her patients .
We are particularly gratified to see her recognized for her work caring for patients in rural Alabama , and for her commitment to rebuilding her rural health clinic in the wake of Hurricane Katrina .
She is a true professional who puts her patients first .
The AMA is immensely proud of Dr . Benjamin's accomplishments , and we are extremely fortunate that she has just served a term as chair of the AMA's Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs .
She served as a member of the AMA's Board of Trustees with the dual distinctions of being the AMA's first young physician trustee , as well as the first African - American woman board member .
We look forward to seeing Dr . Benjamin serve as an advocate for all the nation's patients , as our country works toward health reform that provides high quality , affordable health coverage for all . "
