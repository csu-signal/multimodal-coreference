Meet your new Time Lord !
Doctor Who has finally selected its 12th doctor : Peter Capaldi is officially set to replace exiting star Matt Smith as the TARDIS leader , producer Steven Moffat announced on the live BBC special Doctor Who Live : The Next Doctor Sunday .
Well known for his work as Malcolm Tucker on The Thick Of It , Capaldi , 55 , isn't a stranger to the longrunning BBC hit's fans : He appeared opposite David Tennant in The Fires of Pompeii in 2008 as Caecilius and had a major role on Torchwood : Children of Earth , the Doctor Who spinoff series .
"Being asked to play the Doctor is an amazing privilege , " Capaldi said .
"Like the Doctor himself I find myself in a state of utter terror and delight .
It's so wonderful not to keep this secret any longer , but it's been so fantastic . "
"I just want to wish my successor all the best and say good luck and good on you for getting it , " Smith said in a videotaped message .
"I know he's a huge fan of the show and a really nice guy .
The casting of it made me really excited it .
I think it's a really canny choice .
Good luck , man .
It's going to be a thrill . "
Oddly enough , Capaldi was recently seen in Brad Pitt's World War Z as a World Health Organization doctor , or W . H . O . doctor , for short .
The big reveal was arguably Britain's second most highly - anticipated announcement in recent history , following Prince George's arrival , with BBC even promoting the announcement that an announcement would be made .
"The decision is made & the time has come to reveal who's taking over the TARDIS , " BBCOne promoted on Twitter .
"For the last of the Time Lords , the clock is striking twelve . "
Smith had played the iconic role since 2010 and shocked fans when he announced his his departure from the series in June .
"Doctor Who has been the most brilliant experience for me as an actor and a bloke , and that largely is down to the cast , crew and fans of the show .
I'm incredibly grateful to all the cast and crew who work tirelessly every day , to realise all the elements of the show and deliver Doctor Who to the audience , " he wrote on BBC's Doctor Who website .
"Many of them have become good friends and I'm incredibly proud of what we have achieved over the last four years . "
The series' 50th anniversary special , which all air in November , is set to be Smith's last official outing as the Doctor , but it's been revealed that he will also make an appearance in the Christmas special .
