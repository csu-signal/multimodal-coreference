Testimony in the murder trial of an Albany teen accused in the shooting death of young Kathina Thomas continued for the second day on Wednesday .
The trial against 16 year-old Jerymayne Timmons started a bit late after one juror was dismissed because of a family medical emergency .
Another delay in the trial was an altercation inside the courtroom .
The Albany County Sheriff 's Department arrested one gentleman who refused to leave the courtroom after being asked to .
The man claimed someone had pushed and shoved him inside .
Once the trial resumed , Timmons ' 16 year-old best friend took the stand and talked about the community gun described in a police statement .
He said the .32-caliber gun was nicknamed `` Shaq '' referencing the Shaquille O'Neal 's jersey number .
While on the stand he told jurors that Timmons had asked him to tell police they were together until about 9 p.m. on the night of the shooting .
The teen did tell police that originally , and later confessed that he had only been playing basketball with him until about 5 : 00 on the night of May 29th .
Jurors also heard testimony from a State Police ballistic expert , the emergency room doctor who treated Kathina , and the medical examiner who performed the autopsy .
