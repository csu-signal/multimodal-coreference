A series of earthquakes killed a 10-year-old girl and injured dozens Sunday in remote eastern Indonesia and briefly triggered fears of another tsunami in a country still recovering from such a disaster in 2004 .
One of the quakes -- a 7.3-magnitude tremor -- was felt as far away as Australia and sent small tsunamis into Japan 's southeastern coast .
Residents near the epicenter in Papua province rushed from their homes in search of higher ground shortly after the first 7.6-magnitude quake struck , afraid that huge waves might wash over the island .
The epicenter was about 85 miles from Papua 's main city of Manokwari and occurred at a depth of 22 miles , the U.S. Geological Survey said .
It was followed by dozens of aftershocks .
