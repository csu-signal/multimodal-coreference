T - Mobile Confirms it Will Carry BlackBerry Q10
WEDNESDAY , APRIL 24TH , 2013 AT 10 : 40 AM
For those of you who have been waiting for BlackBerry's new Q10 handset , that wait is getting shorter .
T - Mobile has announced that it will be carrying the keyboard touting Q10 , with pre - registration starting on April 29th .
Pricing and release dates are still TBD , but by signing up for alerts on T - Mobile's website you will be one of the first to know .
If BlackBerry's release of the Z10 to business customers first is any sign , we may very well see the same approach when it comes to releasing the Q10 , meaning that normal consumers may have to wait a little longer for their chance to purchase one of the devices .
Although release details are still absent , this e - mail assures us that T - Mobile will in fact be carrying the Q10 in the future .
The Q10 has been previously rumored to be released sometime in May , which seems reasonable given the timing of T - Mobile's announcement today , as well as BlackBerry's announcement of the device making its way to Canada on May 1st .
Official PR text follows below .
T - Mobile today announced that the BlackBerry Q10 will be added to its growing 4G LTE smartphone portfolio .
Beginning April 29th , business customers interested in registering for the BlackBerry Q10 can visit http : / / business . t - mobile . com / blackberry - q10 .
Additional details , including availability and pricing , will be shared at a later date .
