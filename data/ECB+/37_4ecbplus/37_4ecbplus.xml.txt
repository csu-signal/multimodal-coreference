A 6 . 1 - magnitude earthquake which hit the Indonesian province of Aceh on Tuesday killed a child , injured dozens and destroyed buildings , sparking panic in a region devastated by the quake - triggered tsunami of 2004 .
The quake struck inland at 0737 GMT at a depth of just 10 kilometres ( 6 . 2 miles ) in the mountainous Bener Meriah district in the heart of Aceh , the US Geological Survey said .
Houses collapsed in the district , some 320 kilometres ( 200 miles ) from the provincial capital Banda Aceh .
"A child died when a wall collapsed , " Ema Suryani , a doctor at a health clinic in Lampahan city , told AFP .
"We have received around 50 people with injuries suffered when the walls of their houses collapsed , " added the doctor .
"There are around 30 people seriously injured , some with head injuries .
The rest have only light injuries like minor cuts and grazes . "
Injured people had been transported from several affected villages in two trucks , she said .
People ran outside in panic in Banda Aceh as the quake shook houses , and in Medan city to the south of Aceh province on Sumatra island .
"The quake was felt strongly for around 15 seconds , from Bener Meriah to Banda Aceh .
People panicked and rushed out of their homes , " national disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said .
Aceh , on the northern tip of Sumatra , is regularly hit by quakes .
In 2004 a massive tremor sparked a tsunami that killed 170 , 000 people in the province and tens of thousands more in countries around the Indian Ocean .
In April last year an 8 . 6 - magnitude quake struck 431 kilometres off Banda Aceh , prompting an Indian Ocean - wide tsunami alert .
Five people died and seven were injured in Aceh in the quake and following aftershocks .
In September 2009 , a major earthquake near Padang city on Sumatra killed more than 1 , 000 people .
Indonesia sits on the Pacific "Ring of Fire" where tectonic plates collide , causing frequent seismic and volcanic activity .
