Thursday , Apr 2 , 2009 | Updated 1 : 32 PM PDT
The City Attorney's Office is considering whether to file misdemeanor drunk - driving charges against Chargers defensive lineman Jamal Williams .
Williams , 32 , was pulled over for speeding in his Bentley on State Route 94 around 1 : 30 a . m . on February 1 , but was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving .
He had refused a Breathalyzer test and was given a blood - alcohol test instead .
The results from the test were released Wednesday and showed a level of 0 . 07 percent - - just under the California legal limit of 0 . 08 percent .
CHP Officer Brian Pennings said that the blood had been drawn well after Williams' arrest , meaning he could have been intoxicated when officers had pulled him over .
City Attorney spokeswoman Gina Coburn said the case remains under review and is being investigated further .
