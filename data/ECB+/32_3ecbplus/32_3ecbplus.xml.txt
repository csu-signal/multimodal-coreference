PROVISIONAL TRIAL DATE SET FOR CUMBRIA DOUBLE MURDER ACCUSED
Published at 12 : 45 , Wednesday , 12 June 2013
A provisional trial date has been set in the case of a son accused of killing his mother , sister and pet dog .
A preliminary hearing for John Jenkin , 23 , charged with the murders of his mum Alice McMeekin , 58 , and sister Katie Jenkin , 20 , took place at Preston Crown Court this morning .
Jenkin was due to appear via videolink from HMP Preston but did not do so as he was considered a risk to his own safety and that of other people , said crown prosecutor Susan Carter .
The case was heard in his absence and a provisional trial date was set for October 28 , with a duration of three days .
The bodies of Ms McMeekin and Miss Jenkin were found in their house in Newton Street , Millom , at about 8 . 40am on Saturday .
The family's border collie , named Fenn , was found dead in the backyard of the house .
Jenkin , who was arrested at Millom Pier at around 9 . 35am , is also facing a charge of causing unnecessary suffering to an animal in relation to the dog's death .
No application was made for bail and no plea was entered .
A plea and case management hearing will be held on September 6 .
Judge Anthony Russell QC asked for psychiatric reports to be completed on Jenkin before the next hearing .
