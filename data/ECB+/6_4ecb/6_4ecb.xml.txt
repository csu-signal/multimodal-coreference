Chris Weitz , who directed `` The Golden Compass , '' is negotiating to direct the cinematic sequel to `` Twilight , '' industry sources say .
While Summit Entertainment will not confirm Weitz is attached to the vampire series , The Hollywood Reporter said Friday he is the current candidate to direct `` New Moon . ''
`` Moon , '' like `` Twilight , '' is based on the four-book series written by Stephenie Meyer .
The movies follow a romance between a vampire and a mortal woman .
`` Moon '' will be adapted for the big screen by Melissa Rosenberg with Robert Pattinson and Kristen Bell in the lead roles .
`` Twilight '' director Catherine Hardwicke was unable to reach a deal to direct the sequel and her departure has been the topic of various rumors .
The Reporter said `` Moon , '' which is expected to have a larger budget than its cinematic predecessor , has been tentatively tabbed with a late 2009 or early 2010 release date .
