Sarah Palin actually apologized after the evangelical church she attends was nearly destroyed by arsonists -- all because she still harbors guilt over her failed VP run .
Officials estimated the fire caused around $ 1 million in damage to the Wasilla Bible Church -- which Sarah hoped was n't in connection to the `` undeserved negative attention '' from her failed campaign , according to the Sun Times News Group .
The police have no leads at this time -- and John McCain has not been named as a suspect .
