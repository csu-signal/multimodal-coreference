AMD 's ATI acquisition will not affect India operations
India will figure prominently in AMD 's $ 5.4bn acquisition of ATI Technologies , as both the semiconductor giants have their operations in the country .
AMD has its design centre in Bangalore while ATI 's R and D unit is located in Hyderabad .
Though the exact contours of the merger and its implications in India are not known , both are expected to maintain their existing portfolios of operations as both concentrate on different segments .
`` The combination will create a processing powerhouse by bringing AMD 's technology leadership in microprocessors together with ATI 's strength in graphics , chipsets and consumer electronics , '' AMD said in a statement .
ATI Technologies India MD Dasaradha R Gude told ET that the combination would drive growth and the Indian operations would also be expanded .
`` Our work is complementary to each other and does not overlap .
With this merger , we would also be able to address bigger markets , '' he said .
The AMD statement said , `` We can not speculate on the implications of the merger for another 90-120 days , till the time integration is complete . ''
