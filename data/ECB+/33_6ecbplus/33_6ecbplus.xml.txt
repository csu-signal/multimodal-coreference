Guilty verdict for murderer of Brooklyn mother of 12
A Brooklyn jury has returned a guilty verdict for Andrew Lopez for the murder of Zurana Horton and the injury of two others .
Convicted of second - degree murder and assault in the first degree , Lopez , 20 , faces a potential sentence of life in prison when he is sentenced by Justice Vincent Del Giudice .
In October 2011 , Lopez and his co - defendant and half - brother Jonathan Carrasquillo , 24 , were arrested in connection with a shooting in Brownsville's Howard housing projects .
Surveillance footage , provided as evidence to the jurors , captures the horrific event as it unfolded .
The video shows Horton , a mother of 12 , on the street near a school immediately prior to the shooting .
It shows her attempting to shield herself from the spray of bullets , and ultimately her fatally wounded body on the sidewalk .
"Zurana Horton became a victim of the senseless gang violence that plagues Brooklyn , " prosecutor Seth Goldman said during the murder trial of Lopez and Carrasquillo .
It was said throughout the investigation and trial that Lopez and Carrasquillo were targeting members of a rival gang when Horton and the two other victims killed and injured in the crossfire .
Carrasquillo allegedly ordered Lopez to shoot .
The jury is still deliberating on Carrasquillo's verdict .
Lopez's sentence date is May 7 .
