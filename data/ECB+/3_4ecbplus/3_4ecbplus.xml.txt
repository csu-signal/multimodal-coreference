Texas Prison Escapee Added to U . S . Marshals '15 Most Wanted' List
The U . S . Marshals have added to their ” 15 Most Wanted “ list of fugitives a man serving three life sentences who escaped custody during his transport from Huntsville , Texas , to Stiles , Texas .
During the escape , Arcade Joseph Comeaux , Jr . allegedly produced a weapon and fired upon two correctional officers , took them hostage and forced them to drive to Baytown , Texas , where he restrained the officers in the back of the van , took their firearms and one of their uniforms .
Comeaux ’ s escape is all the more surprising since authorities had mistakenly believed he was paralyzed following a stroke , and was wheelchair bound .
Comeaux fled on foot following his escape .
Comeaux was in prison after being convicted of aggravated sexual assault of a child and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon .
According to Texas authorities , the weapons conviction stemmed from a 1999 incident where he stabbed his wife 17 times while she was visiting him in prison .
