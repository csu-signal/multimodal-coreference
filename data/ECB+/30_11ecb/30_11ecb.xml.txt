Damaged undersea cables disrupting service
Parts of Asia , the Middle East , and Europe experienced Internet and telephone outages Friday when three undersea cables between Italy and Egypt in the Mediterranean Sea were damaged .
The affected cable systems , which run from Alexandria in northern Egypt to Sicily in southern Italy , carry more than 75 percent of traffic between the Middle East , Europe , and the United States .
It 's still unclear how the cables were damaged or when they will be fixed .
Reliance Globalcom , a communications provider in India , told Bloomberg News that there was no time frame for getting the network fixed .
France Telecom said it plans to send a boat to fix the problem and should have service restored to normal by December 31 , according to Bloomberg .
The cable system that was cut is known as SMW4 cable or South East Asia- Middle East-Western Europe 4 .
It connects 12 countries : Pakistan , Indonesia , Singapore , Malaysia , Bangladesh , India , Sri Lanka , United Arab Emirates , Saudi Arabia , Egypt , Italy and France .
Vodafone 's cell phone service in Egypt has been affected by the cable failure , according to Bloomberg .
Mobile phone service between Europe and Asia on Orange was also disrupted , the Bloomberg article said .
Orange officials told Bloomberg that at one point as much as 55 percent of voice traffic in Saudi Arabia , 52 percent in Egypt , and 82 percent in India was out of service .
Telephone providers , such as Portugal Telecom and Reliance , told Bloomberg that they 've been rerouting traffic to other parts of their network to avoid issues .
But this rerouting has caused network congestion , which means slower Internet connections and some dropped phone calls .
In January , undersea cables outside Alexandria were also damaged , disrupting about 70 percent of the communications network in India and the Middle East .
