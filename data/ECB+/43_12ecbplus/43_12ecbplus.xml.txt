AMD to Acquire Server Innovator SeaMicro
February 29th , 2012
In a bold move to boost its position in next - generation servers , AMD will acquire low - power server specialist SeaMicro for $334 million , the companies said today .
The acquisition is a disruptive one for the low - power server landscape , as SeaMicro has been using Intel chips in its next - generation servers , which offer dramatic reductions in power and space usage .
The crown jewel in the acquisition is SeaMicro ’ s networking fabric , which allows hundreds of low - power processors to work together .
The SeaMicro architecture is processor - neutral , meaning it can be quickly adapted to work with AMD ’ s technology .
“ By acquiring SeaMicro , we are accelerating AMD ’ s transformation into an agile , disruptive innovator capable of staking a data center leadership position , ” said Rory Read , president and CEO , AMD .
“ SeaMicro is a pioneer in low - power server technology .
“ We are clearly skating to where the puck is going , ” Read added .
“ This is a great company with innovative IP and great talent . ”
The Importance of the Cloud
AMD plans to offer the first AMD Opteron processor - based solutions that combine AMD and SeaMicro technology in the second half of 2012 .
The company said it remains firmly committed to its traditional server business , and will continue to invest in research and development .
But AMD executives said the acquisition of SeaMicro will boost the company ’ s offerings for cloud computing providers , who are keenly focused on reducing the energy used by their armadas of servers .
“ Cloud data centers are the fastest growing segment of the server market , ” said Lisa Su , Senior Vice President and General Manager , Global Business Units .
“ The cloud has changed the dynamics of the data center and how people think about servers . ”
Su said AMD will offer SeaMicro servers with AMD chips to provide continuity for existing customers .
But the primary focus will be on integrating SeaMicro ’ s fabric technology with AMD processors in “ building blocks ” for its OEM customers .
Downsized “ Building Block ”
The basic building block of the SeaMicro system is a credit card - sized compute block , comprised of a CPU and its chipset , DRAM , and a custom SeaMicro ASIC ( application specific integrated circuit ) .
SeaMicro ’ s patented I / O virtualization allows companies to save money by using fewer cables and network interface cards ( NICs ) to connect to networks and storage .
SeaMicro ’ s early systems featured up to 768 Intel Atom cores in a 10U server .
It recently introduced a server powered by 64 Intel Xeon processors , providing a “ brawny ” offering to supplement the “ wimpy ” Atom nodes .
One of the benefits of the AMD acquisition is the ability to adapt SeaMicro ’ s technology to a broader range of workloads and applications , according the SeaMicro CEO Andrew Feldman .
“ SeaMicro was founded to dramatically reduce the power consumed by servers , while increasing compute density and bandwidth , ” said Feldman , who will become general manager of AMD ’ s newly created Data Center Server Solutions business .
“ By becoming a part of AMD , we will have access to new markets , resources , technology , and scale that will provide us with the opportunity to work tightly with our OEM partners as we fundamentally change the server market . ”
