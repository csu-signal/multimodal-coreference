Authorities say a 35-year-old New Bedford man stabbed his ex-girlfriend and his own mother to death during a bloodbath inside his mom 's apartment and left the bodies to rot for days .
Gary Gomes , 35 , was arrested yesterday and will be arraigned today in New Bedford District Court on two counts of murder and one count of kidnapping in connection with the homicides , according to the Bristol District Attorney 's Office .
The bodies of Robyn Mendes , 48 , Gomes ' ex-girlfriend , and Gomes ' mother , Catherine Gomes , 61 , were found by police and firefighters yesterday in a second-floor apartment on Independent Street , said DA spokesman Gregg Miliote .
Both women had been stabbed to death and their bodies had been there for `` days , '' Miliote said .
Catherine Gomes lived in that apartment , he said .
Police and firefighters were called to the address after neighbors reported a strong smell of natural gas .
A gas stove had been left on and a space heater was running , Miliote said .
Gomes was arrested at a Philip Street apartment yesterday where Mendes lives , Miliote said .
Police say Gomes had allegedly barricaded himself in a room with another person .
Miliote said Gomes was on probation when he was arrested .
The Standard-Times of New Bedford is reporting today that Gomes has a lengthy criminal history .
He had just been released from the Bristol County House of Correction in late 2008 after serving time on a 2006 conviction of assault with intent to murder , the newspaper reported .
Robyn Mendes was the victim in that case .
In 2005 , he was charged with assault and battery on Mendes with a dangerous weapon , according to court records , which indicate he grabbed her by the throat , threw her down , then held a knife to her throat and told her , `` You 're never going to leave me , '' the newspaper reported .
He was sentenced to 2 years , with 9 months to serve in that case .
