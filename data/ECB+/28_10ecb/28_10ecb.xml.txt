Mark Felt , who was known as Watergate scandal informant 'Deep Throat , ' died on Friday .
He was 95 .
Felt worked as the associate director of the FBI in the 1970s and is one of the most famous anonymous sources for the press in American history .
His daughter Joan Felt said her father ate a big breakfast before saying he was tired , and went to sleep , she told the Washington Post .
He died at 12:45 p.m. on Thursday at his home in Santa Rosa , California , the Post stated .
`` He slipped away , '' she said .
Felt blew the whistle on a corrupt administration trying to cover up attempts to sabotage opponents .
He secretly guided Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward and his colleague Carl Bernstein who pursued the story of the 1972 break-in of the Democratic National Committee 's headquarters at the Watergate office buildings .
That ultimately led to the resignation of President Richard M. Nixon .
Felt insisted on remaining completely anonymous until May 30 , 2005 when Felt 's family revealed his identity in an article for Vanity Fair magazine .
