Ellen DeGeneres to Host Oscars
8 : 13 AM PDT 8 / 2 / 2013
She will make her second appearance as the show's emcee on the March 2 broadcast .
Ellen DeGeneres will host this year's Oscars .
DeGeneres herself announced the news Friday morning on Twitter , writing , "It's official : I'm hosting the #Oscars !
I'd like to thank @TheAcademy , my wife Portia and , oh dear , there goes the orchestra . "
Choosing DeGeneres , known for her kindler , gentler humor , signals that the Academy's next awards show will have a decidedly different tone than the 85th Academy Awards , hosted by Seth MacFarlane , who drew criticism for routines like his song about actresses' nudity on film .
DeGeneres previously hosted the show in 2007 and earned a Primetime Emmy nomination for her work .
"I am so excited to be hosting the Oscars for the second time .
You know what they say - - the third time's the charm , " DeGeneres said in a statement .
Zadan and Meron added : "We are thrilled to have Ellen DeGeneres host the Oscars . "
Newly elected Academy President Boone Isaacs said , "I agreed with Craig and Neil immediately that Ellen is the ideal host for this year's show . "
Meanwhile , ABC Entertainment Group president Paul Lee said , "It is an honor to welcome back Ellen DeGeneres as the host of the biggest entertainment celebration of the year . "
