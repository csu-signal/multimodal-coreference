Mannheim , Germany ( Sports Network ) - Wladimir Klitschko retained three heavyweight title belts by scoring a dominant seventh-round technical knockout of Hasim Rahman Saturday night .
The 32-year-old Klitschko ( 52-3 , 46 KOs ) won his 10th consecutive bout by flooring Rahman ( 45-7-2 ) once before referee Tony Weeks stopped the fight 44 seconds into the seventh round .
In a fight that was one-sided from the start , Klitschko retained his IBF , WBO and IBO versions of the heavyweight crown .
Klitschko , who was coming off an 11th-round knockout of Tony Thompson in July , landed 178 punches to just 30 for Rahman .
Klitschko used his jab to his advantage , scoring consistently , and by the sixth round the 36-year-old Rahman , a former heavyweight champion , looked tired and clearly beaten .
In the sixth Klitschko landed a pair of left hooks to floor an off-balanced Rahman , who spent most of his time during the round on the ropes .
In fact , Klitschko landed 28 of his 68 punches thrown during the round , while Rahman connected on just 1-of-16 over those three minutes .
With Rahman getting pounded in the corner early in the seventh , Weeks called a halt to the fight .
Klitschko 's Ukrainian brother , Vitali , is the current WBC heavyweight champion , but the siblings have ruled out fighting each other .
Wladimir Klitschko has held at least one major heavyweight belt since beating Chris Byrd for the IBF version in April 2006 .
On the undercard , former heavyweight champion Riddick Bowe ( 43-1 ) scored an eighth-round unanimous decision over Gene Pukall ( 14-13-2 ) .
The 41-year-old Bowe was fighting for the first time since 2005 and stepped into the ring for a professional bout for only the third time since 1996 .
Bowe is most remembered for his three fights with Evander Holyfield and two tough bouts with Andrew Golota .
