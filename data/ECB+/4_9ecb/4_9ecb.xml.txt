Many people were shocked and saddened to learn that beloved pin-up icon Bettie Page passed away yesterday in Los Angeles after lingering in a coma for a week following a heart attack .
She was 85 .
Personally , I was n't surprised because I thought she died several years ago .
Page is best known by her fans for her risque bondage films and pictures , and her infamous sense of style , which continues to influence everyone from mortician Goth girls to rockabilly cholas in my high school to Dita Von Teese , who 's complete act is utterly ripped off from her .
To me , she 'll always be the kooky , naive Christian portrayed by Gretchen Mol in The Notorious Bettie Page .
But more than that , she was trailblazer for sexy unconventional women everywhere .
Without her , the Suicide Girls would n't exist , although it 's questionable whether that 's a real loss .
I chose the above picture to memorialize her because everyone loves monkeys .
RIP Bettie !
I 'll drink a martini and listen to a Cramps song in your memory tonight .
