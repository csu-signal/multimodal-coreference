COLTS TOP CHIEFS , 20 - 13 , REACH PLAYOFFS
Posted Dec 23 , 2012
Indianapolis lost a 10 - point halftime lead at Kansas City , but responded down the stretch with a touchdown with 4 : 08 to go to earn a 10th victory and a playoff berth with a 20 - 13 victory .
It was not pretty , but add it up after 60 minutes and the Colts will be wearing their white jerseys at least one more time this season .
A Reggie Wayne seven - yard touchdown reception with just more than four minutes remaining gave the Colts a 20 - 13 lead at Kansas City , and the defense made it hold up as the 10th win for Indianapolis ( 10 - 5 ) clinched a playoff berth .
The Colts jumped out to a 13 - 3 halftime lead thanks to cornerback Darius Butler returning an interception 32 yards for a touchdown early in the first quarter .
It was Butler â€™ s second interception returned for a touchdown this year , and the score tied a Colts club record with a total of four on the season .
Any chance for a second half without drama quickly was put to rest as the Chiefs ( 2 - 13 ) came out and tied the game with 6 : 00 minutes remaining in the third quarter .
Jamaal Charles cut into the deficit on the first play of the half with an 86 - yard touchdown run , the longest rush allowed in franchise history .
Ryan Succop hit a 47 - yard field goal moments later to tie the game .
With the offense struggling to sustain drives , it was the Indianapolis defense that stood tall with a stand .
The Chiefs were stuffed on a fourth - and - one in Colts territory early in the fourth quarter , and the momentum carried over to offensive side of the ball .
The Colts embarked on a 13 - play , 73 - yard drive that was capped off when quarterback Andrew Luck found Wayne in the back of the end zone for the game - winning score .
For the season , the Colts were 4 - 4 on the road and moved their record to 9 - 1 in one - possession games .
Luck also set an NFL rookie record for a season with 4 , 183 passing yards .
Defensively , the Colts forced three turnovers , with inside linebacker Pat Angerer causing a fumble in the first half .
Cornerback Vontae Davis recorded his first interception in a Colts uniform in the third quarter , thwarting another Chiefs drive in Indianapolis territory .
Bruce Arians tied an NFL record with nine wins as an interim head coach .
Arians tied the marks set by Hamp Pool of the Rams in 1952 and Wally Lemm of Houston in 1961 .
Indianapolis will close out the regular season next Sunday when the Houston Texans ( 12 - 3 ) head to Lucas Oil Stadium .
