Peter Capaldi favourite to take over from Matt Smith as Doctor Who
Wednesday 31 Jul 2013 11 : 20 am
Peter Capaldi is the bookies' favourite to become the next Doctor Who .
There has been a surge in bets on Capaldi , who plays sweary spin doctor Malcom Tucker in The Thick of It , replacing Matt Smith , according to William Hill .
Joe Crilly , a spokesperson for William Hill , said : 'Peter Capaldi was not even in our list a few days ago but he has been the subject of a lot of betting interest recently and this gamble would suggest that if he does not have the part already , he is almost certainly on the shortlist . '
He now has odds of 2 / 1 to become the 12th Time Lord above Ben Daniels and Rory Kinnear .
Previous favourite Kinnear has slipped down the list after he ruled himself out of the running , claiming he's never seen an episode of Doctor Who .
Capaldi's name may have been linked to the role after Doctor Who creator Steven Moffat said he would not rule out casting an older Doctor .
He said at the recent San Diego Comic - Con : 'We've never not considered an older Doctor .
It is completely on all the lists we make - there are absolutely older Doctors . '
