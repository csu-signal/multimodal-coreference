Saints shut down Bush
Running back to miss games against Lions and Panthers
Reggie Bush 's injury-hit season has come to an early end due to a sprained left knee .
The running back has been placed on injured reserve by the New Orleans Saints , meaning he will miss the final two games against Detroit and Carolina .
The 23-year-old finished his third season with the franchise with 404 yards rushing on 106 carries , scoring two touchdowns on the ground .
Bush picked up the problem in the Saints ' overtime loss to the Chicago Bears in week 15 , a result that ended their hopes of reaching the play-offs .
With nothing to play for but pride in the final two weeks , New Orleans have decided to rest him for the remainder of the season .
It is not the first time this year Bush has had a problem with his left knee .
He missed four games after having arthroscopic surgery back in October .
The Saints signed cornerback Michael Lehan , who had been with the Miami Dolphins , to fill the roster spot , despite being short-handed at running back .
Already without Deuce McAllister , coach Sean Payton will now rely on Pierre Thomas and Mike Bell , who has had only six carries this season , having signed for the team in week 12 .
The Tampa Bay Buccaneers have also lost a player to injury , a fractured right forearm sidelining Jermaine Phillips for the remainder of the season .
The strong safety , who ranks fifth on the team with 86 tackles , was injured during the 13-10 overtime loss to the Atlanta Falcons last Sunday .
Phillips had already missed three games earlier this season with a fractured left forearm .
The Bucs will have to do without him in their bid to reach the play-offs .
Tampa have signed defensive end Patrick Chukwurah and linebacker Rod Wilson to bolster their defence , while releasing running back Noah Herron .
