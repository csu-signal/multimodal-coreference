TRIAL DATE SET FOR MAN ACCUSED OF DOUBLE MURDER IN MILLOM
Posted : June 12 , 2013
A trial date's been set for a Millom man accused of murdering his mother and sister .
John Jenkin was due to appear via video link at Preston Crown Court today but didn't because he's currently considered too much of a danger to himself and others .
The case continued in his absence and a three day trial hearing was penciled in for October - the 23 - year old's due to enter his plea in September .
The bodies of Alice McMeekin and Katie Jenkin were found at their Newton Street home in Millom on Saturday morning .
They'd suffered severe head injuries .
John Jenkin also faces an animal cruelty charge after the family's dog was also found beaten to death .
