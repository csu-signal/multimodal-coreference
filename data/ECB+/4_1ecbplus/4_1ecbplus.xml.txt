Hollywood ’ s mermaid Esther Williams dies
Champion swimmer turned top box - office draw in 40s and 50s
Esther Williams , the swimming champion turned actress who starred in glittering and aquatic Technicolour musicals of the 1940s and 1950s , has died .
She was 91 .
Williams , whose experiences as a young swimming champion led to a career of Hollywood “ aqua - musicals ” designed just for her , died yesterday in Beverly Hills , California , at the age of 91 , her spokesman said .
She died peacefully in her sleep and had been in declining health due to old age , spokesman Harlan Boll said .
It was the pool — and wartime pinup pictures of her in bathing suits — that made her popular .
Williams in a bathing suit became a favourite pinup of US people in World War II , and her popularity continued afterward .
